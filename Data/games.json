Most people who play this game will stay at a basic, casual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has. So, despite my frustration with Brawlhalla, I am giving it a positive review. My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously. However, the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamond, so be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours."

Brawhalla's vast range of unique combos and weapons exhibits such robust creativity to the extent that players only require two brain cells to be godly in this game! Furthermore, Brawhallaâs community is truly the pinnacle of gaming culture, where many players demonstrate good sportsmanship through a variety of fun emojis! And occasionally, players wish to further connect by inviting you to custom lobbies, to enact thoughtful exchanges with one another! I am starting to lose count of the amount of times I have been told to kill myself!! This gameâs only made me break two monitors! Only two!! If thatâs not considered a steal, then I donât know what is! Another positive aspect I feel is overlooked is its mysterious attributes. I will never know the degree of skill my opponent is going to have despite the claimed âaccuracyâ of ELO rating! Hell, I was at 1965 and plummeted back to gold! And I still got paired with Diamond Ranks! This obscure inconsistency adds a whole new excitement as I do not know what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ I am going to do to myself after a match! I am very appreciative of the experience Brawhalla has provided me, as it has excavated whole new emotions that I had yet to discover. To summarize, if youâre looking for that extra push to jump off that cliff or bridge, then this is the game for you!"

Where players will just use movement to bait out attacks and dash away when they miss like other side of the stage. Makes beautiful maps like demon island unplayable. its sad, because i picked this game up in 2020 and it used to be so much more aggressive and winning felt great. Now its just a headache to get through a match win or lose. I tried to smurf to see if things was different outside of diamond, but nope just as bad. I watched recent tourney and notice an insane increase of passive play in NA. Even the pros are worst with passive play, only Brazil and few hand full of pros are playing agro. On a stream sting ray was told he was an agro player.....That's were I said okay their is no return, but what put the icing on the cake was the hold dodge. By far the worst feature ever. Brawl with heavy string, cool highlights, smart agro, exciting plays to passive, reset neatural, two hits, drastically less strings, corner running, bait out with movement, and slowing the game down to the max. Brawl I want to say think you, you were by far the most consistent game I ever play. I truly enjoyed the good time. With that said good fcking luck brawl, game declining and these changes are killing the game. Also that dash change, made players way more passive. They can just dash away from your strings now/ dash to the other side while land. RIP Bmg/Brawl. Thank you for the memories"

            "Comment": "Honestly, this game used to be a love/hate relationship. It was an addiction for a long time, however the last 4 months. I've felt no desire to play this game anymore. I absolutely cannot stand the devs/ community. They don't care about this game nor their player base in any sort of way. They just release new skins every month to grab more of your money. I've spent a lot of money on this game and put a lot of my time into it. I'm finally quitting because no matter how many people speak up about the balance issues, things that need to be changed/ introduced. They do nothing and just release new skins. They nerf the wrong weapons, buff the weapons that were balanced. Change things that didn't need to be changed. The devs just rotate the meta around for each tournament to spice up the game play. There are so many things wrong about this game that could be improved/ fixed if they would just listen to their player-base. Like for example, the weapon throws/ reward for playing super passive ( and by passive, I don't mean playing smart and adapting to your opponents play style. I mean literally just running and waiting the entire game), etc. I know I'm not the only one that feels this way either. Would I have recommended this game in the past? Absolutely, it was different from other platform fighting games and a lot of fun. Would I recommend this game currently? no, I personally have gotten everything I wanted out of this game a long time ago and I only see it going down hill from here. It's just a big money grab. Maybe i'll revisit it in the future if things change. I doubt that will ever happen though. GG â¥â¥â¥â¥ game"

The weapon system however isn't flawless and although I like the idea of a character having 2 optional weapons they all function the same besides three special moves that resemble smash attacks from smash bros, you have up/neutral, forward and downwards which is about the only differences between characters besides choice of weapon. Overall though, this game is a lot of fun to play and if you do need a smash alternative to play with friends out of either not wanting to emulate smash and play through netplay or just not owning a Wii U/3DS this game is definitely worth getting."

However, it has the added benefit over its competitors of being completely free to play. None of the various modes or features are locked behind a paywall, and the only use of money in the game is to purchase cosmetics such as skins and taunts. Therefore there is virtually no impediment for anyone to at least try the game out and see if it suits their tastes. Personally, I can't recommend it enough."

From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a \"hit\" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"

If you wanna get competitive well , be ready to face the ultimate salt machine. People are kind of toxic in lower elo cause of struggle but when you get higher people are getting nicer. Its quite fun to enjoy with friends , easy to compete into events , weekly. Online events mostly as well as BCX and Other Major Events. The controls are quite responsive and caracters are nice and unique in their ways. Nice cosmetics to add up to your favs. In overall nice brawling game if you like smash and mortal combat and killer instincts. Little bit childish but funny. Add up passive players and salty taunts and here you go breaking your controller :P If you sustain yourself you should be fine to enjoy the game"

The brawlhalla community makes brawlhalla itself a unfun game. If you aren't looking to be super competitive and serious and deal with insane amounts of toxicity for doing nothing but playing the game STAY AWAY FROM BRAWLHALLA. Brawlhalla's community is the most toxic ive ever expirenced in all my years of gaming and i say after maining bo3 for 2 years. You wont make friends playing this game you wont have fun because the players wont allow it everyone who plays this game (except for a select few in all of my 1750 hours) is insanely competitive or toxic. Brawlhalla is strictly a competitive game, not for fun and its why im taking a step back from it after putting in close to 2,000 hours and 200 dollars into it. I DEFINITELY do not recommend this game to anyone who plays games for entertainment, brawlhalla isn't what youre looking for."

I'm going to be giving this game a lot of attention, and several fellows of mine have organized a small tournament for which I am eagerly training up for. This game is awesome."

Sure it may be fun playing with friends or for the first 200 ish hours, but after that you start to just get frusturated. I try to like this game, I really do, but the community is down right toxic and the game has some very unignorable problems that just make it not fun to spend a long period of time playing. One such problem is the float meta, you can be vastly surperior in skill to a player and still loose to them because the mechanics of this game promotes sitting back and waiting for your opponent to engage and then simply press the dodge button and punishing them, not a fun time. I have 420 hrs (nice) and can not recommend doing the same. If you're looking for a fun game with friends then go ahead and play it, but do not expect a fun time if you are looking for a new competitive platform fighter."

Also with the small file size, the game installs and updates faster than my childhood being taken away. Also its really just fun to play with friends and family. If you thought this game was a copy of Nintendo's Super Smash Bros than you're more wrong than the RN's who couldn't take care of my mom when she was dying. This game is super original and every character has a unique signature move and two different weapons. Please if you are considering getting this game and are on a fence than you should try the game at least once."

Their patch notes are delivered with good explanations for why they made each change, and they take both game feel and win ratio into account when balancing characters. They update weekly, or nearly weekly, the servers are usually good, and new characters come out regularly."

Just bare with it and improve. Choose a character that you like and grind for a couple of weeks. The way to improve in this game is learning combos and then movement. By now after mastering those too you would probably be in plat. Now is when you really have fun. Learn to space and punish opponent's mishaps more effectively and once you are there you will really see why some people spend so much time in this game. Its a great game with a steep learning curve but after you deal with it, you will be having a great time. If you are into fighting games then this is a must have for you. Besides its FREEE!!!"

The matchmaking system is based on ELO which is shown to you the moment you get into a lobby. the person you are going against is also shown this value and vise versa. In many cases the player that you are going against has a significantly higher or lower ELO than you do, at least in the hundresds of matches and hours i've put into this game thats what ive experienced. This leads to either you getting compleatly destroyed, whitch leads to the toxic behavior i mentioned earlier, or you stomping someone and them complaning about it in the same manner. I can't recomend this game to someone who wants to enjoy it by themselves because unless you are really good and really patient, you aren't going to have fun with it. However if you just want to play this game with friends and try some rediculous game modes and setting, go right for it. (I'd like to point out that i'm mid plat at the time of writing this review.)"

This game is very skill based and is very fun offering a variety of characters for players to choose from. Very frequent updates allow characters to be even. The 1v1 system is great which allows players to show their skill and rakn up. This game is in early access and is one of my most played games. So far I am very pleased with this, good job to the Developers for creating an awesome game. Lastly, has one of the best communities i've been in :D."

The entire community is full of toxic people saying inappropriate and threatening things after almost every public match you play. Removing the chat has helped with the toxicity, but if you can no longer make friends through the game then what's the gain of playing anything but ranked?"

Brawlhalla requires some grind to level up each character, and it unlocks some recolour skins and builds. I main Teros, but since I don't play this game competitively, I have no idea if he is good or not."

Just because Brawlhalla is bad and full of mentally challenged players doesn't mean i will stop playing it, at this point i'm cursed, im in an endless cycle of rage and enjoyment (mostly rage). No matter how annoying the game gets i always come back. There is much hope for this game but not the community, being honest im surprised most players figured out how to install this game with it being on a thing called a website and the title of the game being more than 3 letters long. This game isn't a game, its pain but yet its going places. 10/10, i would stop playing but its impossible."

But for the love of God, if you have anything to do in life, if your mental health is of any importance to you, if you wish to spend your life being happy, then for the love of God, do not start playing this game."

It's all polish and no depth. Attractive and fun, but ultimately hollow. After you've tossed 50+ hours into Brawlhalla and realize there's nothing there, go play Rivals of Aether, or better yet Melee, you can find everything you need to set it up on your PC short of a Melee .iso at blippi.gg. It's way more tough on newcomers but the return on investment and the satisfaction that comes on the road to improvement will be filled with self discovery and epiphanies about the assumptions you make when you're trying to beat an opponent. Heck, you'd probably even be better served by some *pedestrian* 2D fighter which actually has the tools necessary to play mindgames and strategize around player conditioning and mixups."

Skins cost way too much even considering its direct support to devs. Plenty of characters and they're all (eventually) free with enough playing. Game-play is good and connection has always been excellent relative to other online games of similar genres. A ton of 3rd party characters (who all also cost WAY too much) which is cool to see. Gives the game a similar vibe as smash reveals when a new character is added."

Other than that, the game is good fun, even more so with friends. If you're looking to enter the huge competitive scene the game has, be prepared to move everything off your desk to avoid contact with flying objects moving at mach one; no desk is safe, you will rage...a lot."

            "Comment": "As someone who has played this game ever since 2016, I was able to see the changes the game went through. Upon initial release, it looked very promising especially for a time where smash was the only dominant fighting game. Playing the game, it was fun to have a combo based fighting game but also making combos balanced with the option to dodge. However, in the state it has been in, it's hard to ignore the issues the competitive scene may have. I'm sure if you are a brawlhalla player, you have probably complained about passive players at least once (even with not many hours). The dodge mechanic makes passive play awfully common and rewarding in this game; hardly even worth going in unless against significantly worse players. If you want a good visual of what I am talking about, literally watch ANY tournament not played by sandstorm or any other notoriously good players and the issue with dodge becomes more apparent. BMG has attempted to make dodge more balanced by increasing and reducing the cooldown on dodge dependent on if it's grounded, air, etc. But it still haunts this game. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely still ways to enjoy the competitive scene without playing passive but passive play is just sadly more rewarding in this game. Again, as for someone who has clocked nearly 800 hrs across multiple platforms, it's hard for me to recommend this to newer fighting game players and even a few veterans. I do truly hope this game fixes the issues with passive play but for now, I can not recommend this game in its current state."

Kinda do well in a match but lose 9. Win your first match 10. Addiction. What a beautiful sob story of a game"

            "Comment": "as a party game to play with your friends? its fine. mediocre at best. as a competitive solo fighting game one-on-one? garbage. the game's mechanics themselves and numerous weapons actively reward you for sitting there waiting for enemies to approach you, then dodging and punishing them for whiffing. the entire meta of this game revolves around competitive footsies and passive playstyles. AKA the more you aggressive you play, the likelier you are to lose every other match. the only good game mode outside of ranked is experimental, since there are no casual 1v1s, and the entire ranked experience itself is absolutely abysmal. the community is beyond toxic, and its almost like BMG encourages it, because the report button is worthless. i cant go two matches without some idiot sitting on the other side of the stage or spamming sigs and typing \"ez\" in post-game chat after a 6 minute match of annoying, campy, overall braindead play. for the love of god and all that is holy, do not play this game if you want to have fun. go get yourself a real platform fighter, like the new Smash Bros. or maybe Rivals of Aether."

In order to keep winning, if you are playing competitively, you pretty much need to play every day, just to keep your skills up and not die from the tryhards out there. However, if you do play every day, there's going to be at least one toxic player from losing, either your opponent or yourself. Good luck with keeping some sanity, as tryhards and stupidly annoying spammers are going to make you question why you are even playing competitively. The game isn't so bad, for a free game at least. It really just needs some fixing in mechanics and a less toxic community."

They update it alot and have new stuff added. I recomend this game because personally its one of the best \"Free To Play\" Steam games. Only adivce I would give to the creators, is to add new maps more frequently. They recently added 1 new map and I enjoyed playing it alot! I can only amagin how much fun people would have if there were map packs of some sort."

            "Comment": "My word there are too many legends, this is taking ages. Point is, if they're in this game, I probably would. Anyway, fun game, when drunk at 2am. Any other time it is incredibly frustrating just getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ around by people who are for some reason in a rank considerably lower than where they should be, although I guess that comes with the territory when playing a game with a ranking system. The music for this game goes pretty hard, although that could be because I have game sound muted and always have Thomas Bergersen's Protectors of the Earth playing on repeat while playing this game. Actually, that could be exactly why the game soundtrack goes so hard, maybe I shouldn't have factored that into the review. Overall I would have to give this game a score of 4 out of 7, I would give it a lower score, however the disappointing gameplay is really redeemed by the absolutely banging soundtrack the game is put to. I mean, I don't know how much it cost to gets the rights to play Protectors of the Earth by Thomas Bergersen constantly without any other music but I have to say it was absolutely worth every penny spent and whoever made that decision deserves a significant pay raise. Maybe give them the money that was saved by not needing to purchase any other songs. It makes fumbling around trying to spam Orion side sigs seem like something straight out of a fantasy epic. I'm surprised more games don't take from his discography, the man composes good music. If the gameplay were on a par with the truly excellent soundtrack I wouldn't be able to resist giving Brawlhalla the coveted 5 out of 7 rating but alas, it is not. For this reason, I am unfortunately unable to list this game as one of my top 7 games on Steam, but it is fun though, would recommend (Protectors of the Earth goes hard)."

I think the game is good but the balance of the game has messed with the skill gap between players. At 400 hours I decided to actually reach platinum so I could say that I'm good enough at the game to actually give my opinion on it, I haven't touched competitive since and will refuse to for the foreseeable future because the community of the game is toxic and there's no longer any way to avoid it. I'm too good at the game to play with the friends I introduce without completely stomping them and ruining the fun, but I'm not good enough to casually stomp every match I play because I've stopped playing characters like Scarlet who can off screen with only a couple jump reads, or a scythe character who can light combo to oblivion because I don't see the fun in that anymore. I love the game and I'm too committed to quit, and I will not be recommending this game to anyone due to the toxic community and blurry balance of the game. Brawlhalla is a game I'm cursed to care about and keep returning to like Destiny."

It takes similar characteristics, but it uses unique mechanics to define itself as a seperate entity. The unique fighting system involving two different weapon combination is outright amazing. This game deserves more praise for how well, the game is made. For fighting game standards, Brawlhalla has one of the best onlines. It barely gives input lag or lag in general. I've played this game for 2 years. I haven't grown tired of my love for the game. This game is also free on top of that. You perfectly have no reason to not pick it up. :D"

But recently, other games have attempted to capture that same accessible blend of platforming and fighting. If you enjoy Smash Bros. gameplay, but for some reason dislike Nintendo characters, you have options. Originally released in 2017, following a beta in 2015, Brawlhalla remains the alternative platform fighter with perhaps the most staying power. The free-to-play game sports a unique and approachable, if unpolished, set of fighting mechanics that appeals to even veteran Smash fans. Nintendo Switch owners should still stick to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, as that game doesnât lock the bulk of its content behind paywalls. However, as a crossplay-friendly console, mobile, and PC game, Brawlhalla is the platform fighter for the rest of us."

It has the ability to captivate the player right from the start, making it an incredible game. I've spent countless hours playing with my friends and have never once gotten bored. The game's addictive nature and endless fun keeps me coming back for more every time. The exclusive skins and emotes available are also a big plus, adding an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay. I must warn you though, losing or getting punched by an enemy's emote can make you feel a bit angry, but that's all part of the fun. Overall, this game is exceptional that you can play with your friends for hours on end with endless sledging, making it a must-try for everyone."

Over the 8 years I have played this game in ranked 1v1s the amount of times that you will go back in replays and see your moves that SHOULD connect and they dont in game to see it in the replay clearly connect can cause headache induced seizures. Play smash, street fighter, MK, anything other than this flash in the pan cash grab designed for 8 year olds with autism"

This is one of those games where you can do ranked 1 v 1 fights and lose or gain your ELO, losing costs alot of ELO but you wanna keep playing even though you keep losing, then you finally get a win and are satisfied to close the game. Then 15 minutes later you're back at it again. Wonderful, Bravo. Jolly good show governer!"

Along with that, there are many abusable strategies that allow less skilled players to win and be rude such as: spamming signatures, or using jump/back dashing, spot dodging and quick jumping to be incredibly passive, or simply floating a weapon by constantly jumping around and going for only aerial attacks. That being said, this game is still incredibly entertaining and its competitive aspect is only matched by a few other 2D games. Every time I felt like deleting it or playing it less, I just went back to it. It has no pay to win aspect which is good, but I feel entitled to use codes and money to get skins for my favourite legends as it makes the game more fun."

This is just a browser game. with terrible managers.. Poise is vital to continue doing moves, Tezca can hit you a lot in seconds, how can you avoid that in Ranked 1v1? This game will be dead soon if you continue doing wrong moves as a company. Punish new players with grouping them with veterans, and making unbalanced characters. There are characters that cannot be in 1v1 ranked... Horrible devs, horrible decissions. And community? Less I do not say nothing about community behavior."

People would rather crutch on sigs and play like their life is depending on it in both casual and ranked rather than have a respectable and fun 1vs1. They also hate to rematch, whether after losing or winning which is crazy to me. You don't want another chance at winning? You don't want to win against your opponent twice in a row? The majority of the player base is just salty and angry, queuing for the next game instantly while still mad about their last 5 matches. This game is not even rewarding for people that like to try new things, as they are immediately shut down by the players that bask in their ball sweat which is unfortunately 80% of this community. Don't play ranked. Plus I keep on freezing while having a high end pc which tells me how bad this game is optimized."

Its accessibility welcomes players of all skill levels, while its strategic depth offers a satisfying challenge. With a diverse roster of characters and regular updates from the developers, the game remains engaging and enjoyable. Brawlhalla stands as a testament to quality and fun in the gaming world, earning my enthusiastic recommendation to all who seek a good time."

Endless crossovers and paid nonsense. Sure, it doesn't make the game easier to play for anyone, but new legends always overpower until the next legend comes out only to be nerfed into the ground. Save yourself the trouble and just don't bother."

The game is similar to super smash brothers where you select a character and beat up your opponents in multiple different game modes. Its fun casually. But to do well in online ranked modes you better have good internet connection or something. From my experience, some of my attacks \"hit\" my opponent (I get an audio cue telling me my attack hit), but they continue as if they weren't hit. Sometimes my attacks hit, and my opponent suffers only reduced knockback. Sometimes my opponents are able to execute an incredible number of actions right before my eyes, yet when I input a string of commands, there is just insane lag, like my character is moving through thick syrup lol. There are stats on characters that affect move speed and combat speed, but this is just something else."

Everybody has the goal to make you angry and get in your head. I was even asking people at the end of a game, \"Why do you bm and say ez?\" and more than half of the players either responded with \"too ez\" or \"cuz ur bad\" or \"2 make u salty :)\". I have had server problems, not all the time, but when it does happen it is not a good experience. It can be fun to start, but when you meet players who engage themselves inside of the community the game plumits in enjoyment."

This game is for sweaty people only, If you play this game and expect fun be ready for some toxic and sweaty people. The game idea is pretty nice and the collabs of it are amazing and if we ignore the sweating of the intense gamers on this game, this game can sometimes be fun, especially if you play it among your friends. I reccommend playing this game since it's free and it can be fun but i totally do not recommend playing this game daily more than one hour a day, unless you play with bots."

            "Comment": "There must be a counter to this obvious inbalance? Yes there is, it comes in the form of throwing your weapon. Throwing your weapon will hitstun the opponent and allow you to re-equip and attack the opponent within the same frame. Due to the fact that there is no priority, deflection or parry systems in this game it ends up devolving into who can throw their weapon the most. An excellent read followed up by a perfectively timed smash is all made pointless when the enemy throws their weapon at you at the last second with no punishment available for such an audacious and should-be-punishable move. I could go on forever about the games combat flaws but honestly for a free to play game it is good fun but very shallow. I don't recommend taking this game seriously as a competitive fighter as you will disappointed with the shallow button mashing, weapon throwing facade it turns into at high levels of play."

Initially I thought it was one of those games you come in to play with friends from time to time, but as soon as I started playing it I realized that I would love this game. I used to play with my friends in private games and it was a lot of fun, then slowly I went to try ranked, surely if you just started playing, you will find people who will tell you that you are a spammer and that you use a lot of \"special attacks\" as initially many people say... that's what made me keep playing it, the desire to outdo my ranked friends and reach the pro players who played this game, fascinated me how they could know so many mechanics in this game and it made me want to reach the highest peak or receive the rank diamond and finally I did it. After a lot of effort in this game and a lot of playing I think this has been the best time to leave a comment / opinion about this game. There have been a lot of times when the game made me ragequit, but after all I like a lot as a game. I strongly recommend this free game."

At the beggining, this game is fun due to how simple it is + it's fast paced, smash bros like gameplay which hooks you straight away, and even later when it becomes more advanced, it still hooks you as with that complexity comes more fun. The game is hard to describe but all I can tell you is that you should download it + it's free, what's the worst that could happen (possible foreshadow lol)."

I hope the devs seek psychologists and therapists for the trauma they induced and the trauma they must already have to inflict such pain on other people. I never want to touch or see this game again, it turns you into the worst person you can be."

The stage I played in the solo-play tournament, was a king of the hill style 3 on 1 match. Myself and 3 NPC players each used combo moves and various weapons that dropped from the sky to knock each other off the plateau. The characters are cartoonish, but kinda cute and the play-style is simplistic but actually a lot of fun. I normally don't like PVP games, but this one was fun to play. Now it is still in the Beta stage, so it is subject to change, but Brawlhalla would be fun to play with friends as it currently stands."

Instead of every fighter being different, they will always have two weapons that carry over from other characters, just they will always have a unique set and have their own special moves. 1v1 and 2v2 are tonnes of fun but free for all is kind of s sh*tshow of weapon spam, especially on smaller maps. this sucks mainly because it is the only big way to earn xp in this game, I feel 1v1 and 2v2 should have similar gains so people dont feel punished for playing the gamemode they enjoy. (like strikeout is a joke how much xp you get). this game also heavily favors a passive playstyle which you would really never get away with in other fighters which can be kind of annoying, but I don think its as bad as some people say and you can still have fun matches, give it a shot"

The biggest flaw is online which was a big selling point. It is AWFUL, Nintendo do still had not learned how to make a decent online game and is about 14 years behind everyone else, the bad coding mixed with horrible input lag makes the game sluggish. Why am I forced to pay for an online subscription when the game connects of a p2p network and every match is filled with lag to the point where it is not even enjoyable. Not to mention when you set your settings for 1v1 preferred matches you never get what you want and are then put into FFA lagfests. You can go to the arena mode but all that is just a waiting in line simulator when you have more than 2 people in a room. Why can you not switch your characters after a match? There are so many things wrong with this game it makes me worried for Nintendo. There are many more problems that have not been noted. Also Teros I mean kirby is NEEDS A BUFF overall great game! side note fix clash"

It is a very addicting little fighting game that will run on almost any machine and is completely free. Its dynamics set it apart from other fighting games. its simplistic style on the surface is sure to make you think that it is simple, but make no mistake.  this game takes hundreds of hours just to get a basic understanding of all weapons, and hundreds more to master. IF you like in depth technical fighting games, you'll like this. if you like casual fun fighting game play you will like this. Its hard not to like Brawlhalla. Be warned. If you start playing this game it might be hard to stop. Your choice.... good luck."

Nope, no chance, not Brawlhalla. It's honestly astonishing how a game that's been around since 2017 with a dev team that's backed by Ubisoft has such piss poor optimization. In the game there's no way to change your screen resolution or graphics settings, all you can do is change it from Full Screen to either Maximized or Windowed. Unfortunately, that can cause input delays and that's horrible for any online fighter. I know it's a long shot, but maybe by 2031 Brawlhalla will finally have optimization that even old indie titles with single developers have in their games."

When you lose, they'll brag and spam a phrase to make fun of you, even if they only beat you by a little. If you win, they'll call you out for spamming or just complain and say you got lucky. It makes for an overall toxic community with players staring out. Brawlhalla is a free game though, so perhaps I should not harshly criticize it. It can be fun for a few hours at most, but the core concepts of the game make for bland, repetitive and clunky gameplay, and the community will just make you mad."

Once theyâre hooked, it draws them in deeper with a set of great modes and tempting rewards. Thereâs just so much here, and Iâve rarely seen a game with so many enjoyable and replayable ideas in a single package. Playing eight-player matches and classic two-player brawls are only the beginning, and I donât see a reason to stop playing Brawlhalla for a long time."

However the main differences between this game and Smash Bros are the much more fast paced gameplay, the presence of full working weapons (picking a glowing sword will give your character one of the 2 random weapons they can use, each one will completely change and improve your moves) with incredibly different effects, nice stages (all pretty harmless with the exception of a few moving platforms here and there, making each battle a lot more skill-based compared to Smash's hazardous stages), funny extra gamemodes (like one the resembles American Football where you have to bring a ball to the opponent's goal and another one where you are given an endless amount of snowballs as the only attack, actually turning the battle in an hilarious snowball fight) and amazing graphics and sountrack all make Brawlhalla a must-have for any fan of Super Smash Bros or fighting games in general."

            "Comment": "Overall, this game deserves a bigger community and a lot of love. Make sure to support the devs, seen as they are some of the great devs out there for a game like Brawlhalla, The artstyle fits for this genre of a fighting game, It's always been my favorite game since the start and still is, they add new legends about every month or so. They do all they can to keep this game balanced, This game is of the most balanced games i've ever played. Whoever found this review and is thinking to themselves that this game is a crappy version of smash bros, its not. It is its own thing, its so much different than smash and has unique features on its own. You'll enjoy this game a lot more if you dont think about comparing it to smash... anyways, Have fun in brawlhalla"

Each battlefield has unique designs, from simple to complex. Overall, if you are looking for a free alternative to Smash Bros., or you want to play a game with friends, whether online or not, this game is a great choice."

            "Comment": "the servers are absolutely terrible for a game that requires split second inputs. they fluctuate from bad, horrible, reasonable, and every once in a blue moon, fast. but the fast times are fleeting and rare and it makes you want to pull your hair out. nomatter what you do you will never be able to fix the issue. whether you buy a faster computer, internet, peripherals. and for some reason, their ranked set up causes lag in order to \"balance\", which just ends up gimping both parties. the only way this game is fairly competitive is if you happen to be lucky and live in a place where the connection is fluid. but ive lived in 4 different places and i havent found it. if i were you i would avoid this game like the plague unless you want to spend alot of money to fix an unfixable problem in order to chase an opportunity to actually be rewarded for your talent. im plat 5 because i hit a streak of good internet ONE DAY. but mostly i get pushed back down to low plat, and even sometimes high gold. save yourself the headache. the game would be brilliant if it actually did what it was supposed to."

But now itÂ´s actual cancer, servers are unstable and u need the hand of god to help u when u play ranked and hope that the server wonÂ´t crash, certain legends can hit u when on the side of the platform while u wonÂ´t be able to do it cuz u donÂ´t have a certain character move that they have, u need a pastorÂ´s blessing to dodge a scythe combo and the worst of all is the ranked system, whenever me and my friend try to play 2v2 thereÂ´s always one guy that just downloaded the game and his friend was diamond or above for the last 5 seasons. The game is like overwatch and paladins, it was fun in the beginning, and now i get suicidal when i press the play button. The game would be awesome if they just; fix the servers, nerf scythes, fix the hitbox issue on certain legends and change the ranked system, and u have a perfect game."

One second i'm doing a combo on an enemy and then the next second i'm dead. It isn't just me who suffers from the lag and the stupid deaths. My friend says the same thing and we both want this fixed. Please fix your game servers. A few weeks later after you released brawlhalla for the ps4 the servers just went downhill for the computer unlike the ps4 one's they are just fine. Please fix your servers."

The servers have gotten so bad it's borderline unplayable if you live in the US, and everything about the game stinks of DLC. Every week they push out more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ \"limited edition\" skins to try and sell, and neglect to balance the game at all. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game."

Perhaps best of all, itâs totally free, so you really donât have anything to lose by giving it a try. At worst, youâll find a Smash clone that doesnât have a ton of new ideas; at best, youâll find a new go-to for when you have a few friends over for a gaming session."

While its monetization model can be grindy, and some matchmaking issues may detract from the experience, the gameâs diverse roster, fluid gameplay, and frequent updates make it a strong contender in the genre. Whether you're playing casually with friends or climbing the ranked ladder, Brawlhalla offers plenty of value for players looking for an exciting, free-to-play brawler."

But i do not recommend the competitive system on it if you are a stressful player, you probably will get annoyed a lot by finding pro players when you are a novice.

Really easy to learn, great graphics, the netcode looks good, not a \"pay to win\" (the store is only cosmetics and characters can be buy with in game money you earn by playing). If I understood well the game is cross-play PC/Playstation 4, you're never alone for play. Oh yeah, Brawlhalla worth the download. Try it at least once, you'll laugh for sure."

            "Comment": "Great game, but was ruined by the devs, salty players, and updates in general. I started playing this game back in 2015, when it first went into open beta, and I used to play it a lot and really enjoyed it, but I pretty much just gave up on it when Ragnir (the dragon legend) came out. This game had a lot of potential and now it's rubbish. I've lost my patience with this game, to be honest. Every legend that came out after Ulgrim has either been broken, over-powered, or both (usually both). The game is very unbalanced at this point. New legends get all the attention while the old legends are neglected and most are completely outshined by the new ones. Most of the old legends, especially the classic ones (from Bodvar to Teros) have simple, extremely basic moves that can't even compare to the signatures of the new legends (e.g. usually just a simple swing of a weapon for old legend signatures). By contrast, newer legends (legends that came out after Ulgrim) have strong, fancy, detailed signatures/movesets that have a lot of range, are fast, and/or do a lot of damage, and so they're much stronger and are much easier to spam. Some of the newer legends even have unique abilities no other legend has, and while that isn't bad in and of itself, it ruins the balance of the game since older legends don't have unique abilities. And yet, the devs just seem to be neglecting older legends and don't revamp them, balance things out, or anything (and no, adjusting a single hitbox or boosting knockback by 1 does not count as \"balancing,\" so don't try to say they aren't neglecting older legends). And we haven't even gotten to weapon balance (swords outclass most other weapons, spears are easy to spam, etc., and this has been a problem for a long time), older weapons versus newer weapons (gauntlets and now scythe, especially), the extremely toxic community (almost as toxic as Rumble Fighter's community), the intense lag (you can literally be attacking your opponent one moment and suiciding the next without knowing what's happening, among other things), etc. Overall, the game could've been so much fun and had a lot of potential, but the devs seem to have just screwed it up and haven't really listened to the community's complaints, mostly because the toxic players outnumber the other members of the community and are louder than they are, and that's because most of the other players have left BECAUSE of the toxic community, so it's just a cycle in that sense, where toxic players come, other players leave because of the toxic players, more toxic players come, and the cycle repeats. The game also isn't very friendly toward rookies. Most people that I knew that used to play this game during its earlier stages (\"veteran players,\" if you will) seem to have just quit playing. I made it to Diamond (the highest rank) and I can't even say I'm proud of that accomplishment, since it really wasn't worth it. I could say more, but I think I've made my point. I can't recommend this game anymore. It's still free to play, but it's definitely no longer fun to play."

If you don't care about winning too much or don't care to get good enough to play somewhat competitively. Playing casually means you won't run into the toxic community and notice anything broken or bad. It seems that some of the team really like what they are doing, but overall the publishers want the money so all the updates are full of paid items, with sometimes a year going by before a decent update."

That's one thing Smash and every Smash clone doesn't do. Everything else is inferior and the microtransactions are a joke. I truly feel sorry for you if you spent a penny on this game. Especially now that the Battle Pass is starting to give a few goodies for free via achievements. The entire meta is just exploiting the game's mechanics. Every crossover is a joke except for Rayman being an original moveset. But his smash attacks are a little too slow and weak so charging is very situational. Fun with friends, but treat it like a secondary game after being burnt out playing long sessions with real quality games."

They added dash, shortened the dodge length, removed non-hitting chain dodge, and messed with some other â¥â¥â¥â¥. This was uneeded, unwanted, and not helpful. A huge portion of players left the game do to this, and the majority of the player base was not happy with the change. But the Devs didn't care what the community wanted. Which is why there Overwelmingly positive review dropped to mostly positive in just a few days. Even after this, they still decided to keep it in. They got to the point where they created an echo chamber around themselves. Telling anyone wanted to remove dash to just shut up and suggest something different on streams. This game and it's devs used to be amazing, and had a great relationship with it's community. This did not last after Dash as many of the players felt betrayed. This game was amazing and still could be. But they need to get their act together, realize they made a mestake, and LISTEN to their community."

            "Comment": "OK, first of all I have played this game for months and am Gold in both 1v1s and 2v2s. I have many hours in smash bros and a few in Rivals of Aether but I have always loved Brawlhalla. This game is appealing for its simplicity and fast paced gameplay. Observing reviews I've seen a lot of complaining about spamming and to that I say spamming is equaly prevalent in most other platform fighters.  My friends introduced me to this game as a way for my smash playing friends and I to play a game like this with friends that don't play smash. At first that is all it was, a smash substitute of sorts, but as I improved and learned the controls my relationship with this game evolved and I was grinding the game even when my friends weren't online to play with. The legends are all very well balanced partly because of the similar sized hurtboxes and similar speed, attack, and defense stats. Another reason I rarely get salty because \"the other legend is just too OP against mine\" is because each legend essentially has 2 built-in play styles in the form of their 2 weapons. This means that if you are struggling with one weapon, the other weapon might not have such a hard time. Coming from Smash Ultimate I was used to one-off approaches and far from true combos but this game allows for much faster paced gameplay and combos if you use the right characters. The devs truly love this game and give it regular updates as well as supporting the eSports scene greatly. For people who truly dislike this genre of game, this game might not change that, but to people who just haven't found a platform fighter that interests them I would say to try this game and get a few hours in."

            "Comment": "this game is so different to every other fighting game and that is not in a good way, the basic fundimentals of fighting games apart from your standard attacks are thrown out the window in brawhalla, every attack in the game is unbelivable safe to throw, in 99% of situations you cannot just \"dodge and punish\" like in other fighting games, this is due to the fact that almost always, after dodging an attack you will not be in the right possition to able to hit them back and punish, this leads to hyper aggressive players dominating games, which just leads to a battle of who has the weapon that is better in this matchup, you can even get to diamond and 2100+ just by being hyper agressive against your opponent, as someone who has spent far too many hours in this game grinding ranked just for a shiny little purple banner and profile picture, i advise you with everything i have, if you want to pickup a fighting game to play seriously and see how high you can climb in skill level, DO NOT, pick brawhalla"

First thing if you wanna get into ranked. Once you get to gold its going to be hell. Sig spammers everywhere. Second thing is about the weapons. The two most annoying weapons to face are the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ \"AXE LEGENDS\" and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ \"KATARS\". These weapons are super OP. Most of time in ranked when you see the players that use these weapons. They're usually super toxic. At the end of day  I would recommand this game to play with friends. But if you want to play ranked its not a good idea. It will just make you tilted. Oh and one more thing if you have poor internet connection. You might as well not play the game. You'll just teleport everywhere on the map."

I never get bored of this game and it's very nice to play after a stressful day to just have some fun. I would recommend this game to people who enjoy games such as Rivals of Aether and Smash, however I would also recommend it to anyone who likes fighting games in general. The art style is also very unique and each character has their own custom backstory. There is really not much to dislike about this game."

Brawlhalla is a very good game which is a 2D game and if you don't think you will like it, trust me, try the game and it might become one of your favvourite games of all time. And one other thing about it is that it is free to play. And it is also multiplayer and you can also play on controller and even on mobile. I think it is a very underated game and i thinki it should get some more love into it. There are many legends you can choose from and there is a lot of content. Also the game is not pay to win but you can buy cosmetics. I belive you should try ait out."

The only flaw is that some of the hitboxes are not inline with the animations which can cause unfair damage. Overall definately recommend you give this game a go."

Simply put; the devs have simply made this game easy for players to spam and camp and be passive while for the fighters, like myself, it's hell because we can't fight any good opponents. I used to like this game. Now it's bad."

In Brawlhalla, get your friends together to fight in this unique 2D Action game with new characters and weapons! For free! Don't worry about money, as this game is one of the best out there for users who cant spend all of their money for free. Unlike other free to plays, Brawhalla does not infest your screen with in game purchases. You can even player with multiple players on the same computer! Great game.

This game was such a fun concept, but the devs are trying SO HARD to ruin the fun. Ever since Greatsword the game went downhill. Greatsword, Battleboots; both not 'Brawlhalla-like'. Both unbelievable *not fun* to play against. Cross-overs are pay to win. Audio is most of the time not audible, sigs are unrecognizable. Make it an option so that you can turn off all skins (i know, not good for the moneys, but come on). Also make weapon spawns less random, more center-stage based and let the player know earlier when the weapon is going to spawn. This way, players with stage-control, will have the upper hand. Also, please make a friendly 2s gamemode WITH teamdamage so i can play with friends, without having to worry of losing elo, without having to worry of playing a misserable 3 minute game against spammers. Also... Also... Also..."

If they want to improve this game's community they should honestly just remove all the purchasable taunts from the game and refund everyone's mammoth coins. After this implement character exclusive taunts that are unique to each legend's personality , like Smash Bros.  Maybe even make the taunts vary depending on the weapon they have in hand. I understand they may want to keep making money off people purchasing taunts. So what ya'll should do is release taunt packs that are UNIQUE TO THE CHARACTER'S PERSONALITY for a random legend every once in a while, similar to how they randomly pick characters to drop skins for. I don't know why they thought introducing a \"Salty\" or a \"Read you like a book\" taunt would contribute to an enjoyable community but.... Brawlhalla's community makes this game so unpleasant to play, not to mention some of the absurd hitboxes, unbalanced weapons, and patches they have, sometimes my inputs don't even go through. I've been playing for about 3 years and I haven't got on this game once and not gotten irritated."

            "Comment": "I'm gonna be real, this game is horrible. For one, the meta in this game is the worst thing you will probably ever see come out of a videogame, there are way too many OP characters and weapons such as lance, and im getting tired of fighting loki for the 17th time in a row because he's op in lower ranks and the devs only appeal to the pros. Horrible servers as well, and the worst thing about this entire game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ player base. Everyone on here talks â¥â¥â¥â¥ but is playing the most no skill character. I personally advise to buy a Switch and get super smash bros instead of playing this game. There are no skill little rats that have spent 8k on this game and are sitting in silver/gold lobbies spamming loki. Half of ranking up in this game is praying that you don't go against a lance character or that dumbass turtle that thinks hes master Uogway or however tf you spell it. To the devs please take lance out, im getting tired of perfectly timing dodges just to get a combo that does the same damage as the lance deals in one side special, fix ur game."

Just fix this broke ass problem to save brawl for future generations."

There are many mechanics of the game that are easy to learn and once you master them you can quickly climb the ranks and gain Glory through Ranked 1v1. There are many different weapons in the game, and each legend has a unique combination of two different weapons.  There are also many fun game modes, such as FFA, Strikeout (where you choose 3 legends and you use a different legend for each of your lives), Friendly 2v2, Ranked 1v1, and Experimental 1v1. There are also weekly special brawl events, such as Kung Foot and Bubble Tag, but there are many more. Overall, Brawlhalla is very fun to play and it is enjoyable when you learn new skills."

GOD â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ FORBID you get into ranked and decide to grind out to see how good you are at the game. you'd assume that as time progresses you'd get better and better right? wrong. I've reached diamond ONCE through my history with this game. yeah i might just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ be bad but HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ the community is actual dog ass, you either have someone playing a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ broken character like QUEEN NAI and sig spam the entire game leaving ZERO room to be punished since her signatures come out so fast AND ON TOP OF THAT SHE CAN HAVE NINE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DEFENSE!!!!!!!!!! so even if you DO punish her it's like you're tickling her with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wet napkin. OR you go against some braindead â¥â¥â¥â¥ who has only ever touched SCYTHE their entire â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ life and they bleed you of every. single. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ option you have. you want to dodge? sure go ahead! they catch you with a down air. want to punish? try it! you get hit with a nlight. YOU WANT TO TOUCH THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GROUND AND BREATHE??????????? NLIGHT NLIGHT NLIGHT NLIGHT HAHAHAHAHA OOOOO SO BAD OH UR ASS GET GOOD. from the bottom of my heart stay as far away from this game and its toxic, virgin, reddit moderator, low life community as you possibly can. if you want to play casually then by all means waste a few hours away with your friends on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. but if you EVER think about getting into ranked, please do yourself a favor and stay. the. â¥â¥â¥â¥. away. you are not pavelski, you are not eggsoup, cody travis, sandstorm or any of these professional players and 99.9% of you will never be. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you BMG, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Ubisoft, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to every lowlife piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ sig spammer, one trick, and lvl 100 sweat i hope you all keep playing this game nonstop so that no normal everyday person has to interact with you. you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ parasites."

However you decide to play this game such as a joke, for fun, competitively, or just to battle your friends I know for a fact that you won't want to let go. Actually understanding this game sparks a desire to understand more about it, and to practice, learn, play, lose, win, flex, enjoy, share, and connect through this free-to-play fighting game developed as Brawlhalla. For a lot of people, this community and game becomes apart of their childhood, life, hobbies, Content, and even their job. For me the nostalgic feeling of Brawlhalla reminds me of when I first opened it on my first hour. interested and curious of how I could become something in Brawlhalla so then Brawlhalla could become something I feel is apart of me. From all the friendships I've created, to all the wholesome post-game conversations I've encountered. There's always a light side to look at when playing Brawl. I have played the game for almost a year now and currently have more then 2,000 hours on record. I've played while being open with a passion to be the better player I always know I can become. Interested in tournaments and Discord servers it becomes so easy to sink into Brawls welcoming community. With amazing content creators, friendly players, and very skilled professionals when you look in through the window you might finally realize you aren't outside, and in fact outside is through the door you could never find, until your spark of an interest let you find the way. The small and hidden aspects of Brawlhalla are what let it establish it's unknown qualities while being known for as a seemingly upfront free-to-play. The part of my life history that relates to brawlhalla will be remembered until I no longer have any memory at all. I seek for more in the depths of high tier game-play and communities as for now and the future. I'm not sure when I'll let go of a such a loving hobby and passion, and I'm not looking forward to. I truly hope others and more can experience Brawlhalla the way I did, with hope for prosperity and the scope for communion. People who read all of this will already have enough devotion to spark an interest in the game I've loved so dearly. Thank you."

Removed the only form of communication with other players, which makes the game even more toxic. Only thing people can do now is spam useless emotes and you cant even make friends on the game anymore because you cant speak to them post game. The amount of times this game has made me re-download it just to uninstall after one game is surprising. Don't waist your time.  No one relies on skill anymore in the game its all mindless spam, no one tries reading dodges and all people do is spam the same 2 - 3 combos over and over again. Every time I look at this game again they some how figure out how to mess it up even more."

After they added dash brawlhalla has never been the same, the game is broken and the recent new legendshave been jokes. I'd rather put my â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a blender and watch hannah montana on repeat for 26 days instead of spending anymore time with this masochistic torture device. I personally oblige you to skip this game, its not worth your time."

But in the end this game will forever stay early access because BMG is basically like \"yo dudes this game is gonna be totes radical dude just buy the skins and cosmetics xd\". Don't get me started on this dodge \"reading\" â¥â¥â¥â¥, all the combat system is, is a turn based real time strategy when you're waiting for your opponent to dodge and then punish the hell out of it with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fast ass sig. I've been in Platinum rank consistently and Diamond out of the 4 seasons i've played, and all I gotta say is this ELO system is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, where the elo you gain is scaled off of the opponent's elo which is retarded because if I lost against a player that had a much higher elo than me then i would lose like 20-30 elo but if i won i'd only gain 9-13 elo. All in all, this game is a good attempt at a \"pc smash brothers\" but just buy ROA where there's actual balancing and not just cosmetics being added every patch."

All the moves are laggy and the game feels terrible to play. The game is so unbalanced right now that the neutral consists of jumping around and waiting until the opponent messes up and tries to engage you. The devs have no idea how to create a game that is endearing or fun to play."

Additionally, while the game is free, there are microtransactions for cosmetic items, which might not appeal to everyone. Despite these minor issues, Brawlhalla remains an excellent choice for a fun and competitive multiplayer experience. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just looking for something to pass the time, Brawlhalla is a must-try."

I know that my Steam profile will show you that this is my second most played game so perhaps you would expect it to sit comfortably within my top 7 games on Steam, but it does not. It's really not my thing, because, as stated previously, I don't play fighting games. If you are someone who enjoys fighting games, I can't say whether you would enjoy this game, all I know is that I did, sometimes, when I was winning, which was definitely not even close to half the time I spent in game. Again, comically large skill issue on my part."

Because it doesn't have too many complicated mechanics/combos (aside from combos that use the very basic attacks that are in the game), anyone can pick up and play the game, so it's a nice bonding experience. After playing a total of 3000 hours across all my accounts, the game got pretty stale, but if I could spend those 3000 hours again, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Lovely game, lovely devs, do check it out!"

            "Comment": "The amount of time I've spent in this game would be surprising considering the score I'm giving it, but I cannot seriously recommend Brawlhalla when there are so many better ways to use your time. There's NO community in any online game I've faced (not even other F2P games such as LoL) that is as toxic as this one is. If you don't live close to one of the servers for this game your connection is jsut utter garbage. You're always gona have some sort of input lag. If you've ever played any fighting game you'll realize this game is very unbalanced and devs just cycle through metas to hype the tournaments up basically as they know exactly what they're doing and it's not balance. There's no penalty for doing or not doing stuff here (NO Rock Paper Scissors type of design you find in literally EVERY OTHER FIGHTING GAME). The whole economy behind this game revolves around being an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, taunts are the best selling in-app purchase by a mile. If you don't live in the US (or one of the 1st world countries) then good luck trying to buy anything as the premium in-game currency price isn't region adjusted. The more you play and the farther you get (up to Diamond) the more passive and boring the game becomes. There's footsies, there's defensive oriented characters in other fighting games but this is ridiculous... some matches will be stalemates where your opponent will literally just run away. As a matter of a fact, running away is objectively more effective than anythign else which is an incentive to play passively. Why? Because you have more options to run away, dodge, defend, throw your weapon, etc than you have to approach. Why would I recommend a game whose population is mostly kids yet it has the most toxic players ever? Everyone is tired ofthe toxicity, of the passiveness and the overall same-ness of the game. You don't have to believe me if you don't want to, few people really talk about this but it is the truth"

The dodge mechanic makes it easy to escape combos and move around but it makes neutral a horrendous experience. Dodge is quick to recover and is basically a get out of jail freecard. Furthermore, the game has a lot of input lag so it isn't a crisp and fast feeling even with good internet. Lastly, community is toxic. This game has taunts and emotes to add further salt to injury. Playing ranked never felt good as everyone became so rude and protective of their elo. I recommend either Smash Melee or Rivals of Aether 1 or 2. Brawlhalla is only a fun game if you plan to play casually. No I am not a scrub, I was fairly good sitting between 2150-2200 diamond when I peaked so I ain't lying."

It's filled with toxic people and smurfers in ranked gameplay which doesn't make the game fun and the signatures to the game doesn't make any sense at all when we should know not to get hit by it even though it confirms we got hit. I generally think the game isn't fun despite this game is toxic and is filled with many questionable things and I wished the devs understood this themselves. We never asked for skins, we asked for a better game and I've wasted at least 2 years in this game and I've only reached platinum. I could easily beat diamonds and all such but can't beat a couple of golds and show their hate towards me with toxicity and I am here so confused on how I lost to them when I am obviously so much better than them. Only if the Devs in the games fixed the games and stop focusing on skins this'll maybe be considered by far my favorite game only if they didn't add skins. Not only me, but other people who complains about this game too. We all want a balanced game, not skins."

I am completely done with this game. I quit. i will say this, my last memory on this game is a red raptor riding his Kawasaki 150 into my shaft at 250 mph sigging me into the edge. Also the ranking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I beat diamonds and mid plats and guess what rank i get, Gold 2!!!!!!! yeah i wish i never bought any microtransactions into this horrible game im done."

This game's combat is more complex, faster, combo-focused, and rewards aggressive play whereas Dark Souls is the opposite. Dark Souls is simple, slow, poke-focused, and rewards defensive play. But... that's what makes this game SO fun! This game is unashamedly about the combat whereas Dark Souls is more about the atmosphere and exploration. If you want to play a challenging, intricate, and stylish action game with fun combos then this is the game for you. I hope this clears up any confusion about whether Nioh is like Dark Souls. It's not. It is like a spiritual successor to Ninja Gaiden with Action RPG elements and... that's a good thing!"

It will push you to your limits at times, but when you finally defeat that boss you've been stuck at for an hour+ you will truly feel like a master of your weapon, and every fight makes you learn and adapt to become an unstoppable, indestructible force of nature."

Each early level and boss fights are designed to teach you subtly on skills you need to pass (learn to dodge and counter attack effectively, how to know when to be aggressive or putting on defence, realising how mobile you are and how to use it to your advantage, etc.), it might be hard but it is fair and rewarding. The length and depth of the game is worth the price; the gameplay action is fast, fluid, and visceral; the story and the setting of feudal Japan is interesting in its own rights."

Tecmo has done an alright job with this ... so far. Though the game isnt \"optimized\" to give a geniuine pc experience ( graphics, uncapped frames, etc.), it still does live up to be the souls-like witcher game I imagined it be.

If yes, you're like me, and you'll probably play Nioh for long enough to notice its weird quirks and flaws, loving it all the while. If that sounds terrible, stay away from this game."

The game is alot better than the mixed reviews would make it seem. Definite buy if you have a average pc as it doesn't take advantage of ultra wide monitors and such."

That said, if you do enjoy difficult games and have a taste for a long play, this is a terrific action title that can keep on giving almost indefinitely. One note though, a controller is an absolute must-have to play. Trying to play Nioh with mouse and keyboard is a disservice to both you, and the game."

If you are looking for playing the game in co-op mode, then remember that it will be unlocked after beating the first boss on the ship, after around 2 hours of gameplay and a lot of deaths obviously."

There's a breadth of skill trees for all weapon types, three different forms for how you use them that completely change their moveset, and expansive ninjitsu/magic systems. You HAVE to know your enemies in Nioh. You will not prevail until you do, almost instinctually. It cannot be brute forced, it must be comprehended. If you are willing to embark on that quest, you'll find a much more rewarding, much more satisfying experience than any other game in the genre. If you are not willing, I don't blame you. \"Nioh is hard\" is an understatement."

I'm running out of text, but I said most of what I wanted in my rambling. You'll get used to it, and you can really overpower a lot of things when you learn how to use your skills, weapons, and other passives to full advantage. There is no right or wrong way to play Nioh. Almost any build can survive if they are strong enough. Armor and weapon levels are much more important than keeping your favorite old one. Always go for new stuff in each region and new game cycle when you can!  Trust me, you'll thank me later.  Amazing game 9/10 on my scale."

Story sucks big time but the characters are great, with each of them having their  own morals and values in war  when  fighting each other on the battlefield which truly makes the boss fights stand out.  The gameplay is 10/10. But I do hope they fix the auto aim with the keyboard and mouse and the contectivity issues of the game. Other than that it is a  fantastic, truly  one of a kind action game which everyone should play! If you like dark souls then you should definitely buy this at full price. The content and lore  within the game is endless and you will love playing through each of the five difficulties within the game."

You can spend 8 minutes on a boss, miss 1 dodge and you're finished. Will keep going for a while as I like the overall game, but it feels like a needless punishment. If I walk into a boss fight with 80% health, i might as well walk in with 1%, theres no difference itÂ´s kinda fake challenging for me this game... itÂ´s made a bit to hard i will play it to the  end bc iÂ´m not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! good story fun game you can make it yourself easy with the magic on your weapons and throwing bombs and stuff i was not using that until 35 hours in xD"

Enemy variety is unfortunately a big issue, though if you don't try to complete every quest, you might not notice it as much as I did. If you do end up playing the game, try an odachi out. An odachi is a gigantic katana with heavy slashes, and it makes you feel like a total badass. But if it's not your thing, no hard feelings."

After a 5 year break I game back to it, probably with a very different frame of mind, and just love it. It's souls-like for sure, but with it's own take on things. Once you get used to the mechanics of the game, it starts to make sense, and becomes very enjoyable. Give it a shot. If you don't like it the first time round, try coming back to it again in 5 years like me!"

Game-play is smooth (at least it was for me) Graphics are great, story is good. 8/10 over-all because getting 100% was a chore with RNG for some items."

After deciding to sit down another hour or two after the first hour of exploring, it turned into fourteen hours obsessing over slaying high level revenants, destroying all enemies before resting at the next shrine, finding the kodama, reforging equipment, speed running old missions for gold to reforge equipment, replaying old missions to find the kodama. This game is intense, but if you like a challenge, it can be a total joy to play. Not for the faint of heart, much like the souls games, however its a new action-rpg experience that you won't ever know till you try Nioh!"

            "Comment": "This game is NOT dark souls and is not meant to be compared to DS. What Koei Tecmo did was create an elaborate hardcore Action/RPG with elements of looting and progression through character customization. The setting takes place in medieval japan (i believe edo period) and you play as William. Nioh is an amazingly beautiful adventure crafted in a demonic alternate history of Japan while retaining some non-fiction elements such as certain characters and locations, the combat is easy-ish to learn and hard to master while upgrading your characters skills and abilities from a good size \"skill tree\" to chase that build and play style that not only you love but also to eventually be able to feel confident going into battle. For those that fear \"ohhh this is a game where ill be OP and itll get boring\" fret not because even at high levels and huge dmg output you can still get 1 hit by even the most simple enemies. If you're into japanese culture and love a good hardcore action RPG with looting and deep style progression then Nioh is for you, personally I absolutely LOVE Nioh and can't wait for the second installment! There is however one downside to the PC version though and that is this game is meant for a controller. At least IMO because on a controller it feels so much more natural and comfortable than having to figure out what all these wonky keybindings are, and yes you can play with a keyboard and mouse but for this game i just didn't find that right. Other than that i'd have to rate this game 10/10 for the literal thousands of hours you can put into it, solid gameplay mechanics, beautiful art style and graphics and a compelling (enough) story to follow."

Take the level structure of a soulslike (Fromsoft games still have better level design), the loot system of a typical Diablo-style ARPG and then incorporate a combat system with as much depth and variety as the best spectacle fighters. The combat is twitchy, fast and demands you time your attacks (Like Ninja Gaiden). Each weapon is useful and fun it's just a matter of mastering them. While definitely challenging (Sometimes cheap with an overabundance of ambushes) its satisfying to play. The story is hard to follow but when your gameplay is this good the story doesn't have to be anything special. The endgame can feel more grindy then you'd like and leveling up endgame gear is an odd process of recycling gear. These don't detract from this being an amazing RPG for us twitchy masochists (Team Ninja fans)"

Granted its mission/level based game rather than interconnecting place, but the game offer a ton of replayability through its NG+ system. Upgrading equipment is pretty convoluted but when the game 'clicks' you'll get ton of enjoyment playing through. NG+++ (Way of the Wise) is required for platinum/all achievement run, finished mine on level 397/125 hrs in. Definitely recommend solid 8.5/10."

The only souls resemblance is the \"you die you loose your xp and have to retrieve it\".  I loved this game, but hate when people mistake this for something it isn't then crap on it.  If you love an action RPG with a huge farm factory attached, this is the game for you.  Also, it's worth noting that this game fits any level of commitment.  At a certain level of play, the co-op can become difficult when you're tossed into missions that require Abyss gear and are at difficulties you haven't even touched."

Its a very fast paced action rpg, with very heavy rpg elements, almost closer to Diablo in terms of loot. Lots of replay value and content, but the port is not perfect. Especially in co-op, the slowdown on my machine is unreal. PvP is dead. Definitely worth a buy, especially on sale."

Those aspects are easily forgiven, though, because the game is a joy to play and hard to put down once it's claws have sunk in."

For me, most of this game is fun, but I dislike the unbalanced double boss fights, DLC 1 and the grinding for that. From what I heard, the more playthroughs you do, the more unbalanced and grindy it gets. If this genre is your cup of tea, I say give Nioh a shot, but only do the first playthrough for the optimal experience, then go for Nioh 2."

You check all four corners, all four walls, you lure the enemies out and kill them one by one, then proceed to fall through a floor trap and die. Gear and stat system has a lot of depth but you're going to need to read the ultimate guide to figure out what Parry actually means and why it's lame. Lore is packed with Japanese mythology and historical figures like Oda Nobunaga and Afro Samurai. Clan war system is cool but whichever side has Date will always win. Join Sho anyways. The port quality is eerily similar to the Dark Souls 3 port quality so take that as you will. Overall an excellent game if you enjoy being angry, stressed, or scared all the time."

Well you might say, that it is not even a real soulslike, it is more than that. it has fast combat, which i like and has an item system more close to diablo. The item system is a bit overwhelming at first and not perfect but keeps you replaying the game. challenges are definitly there and the thrills. If you die too much you have to adapt your build and playstyle. This gets better along the game. All in all a very good game and nioh 2 builds on this foundation."

Also enemy variety is pretty low. otherwise a worthy game in the actionRPG genre that I seem to like so much. Thanks for your time."

You're never forced to farm or grind for anything, i reached NG++++ without ever having to farm or play the same level even twice, so i don't know what these people are complaining about nor do i understand complaints about enemies being too tanky, that means you don't know what their weaknesses are. try to utilize different elements for chaos debuff, aim for the weak spots etc. skill system gives you freedom for anything you want to try, weapons and gear are done in a way which allows you to experiment as much as you want. weapon variety is huge and each one has 3 different types of stances with their own separate skills that you can use to enjoy combat and find your personal playstyle, whether its playing patiently and waiting for a proper time to parry or to barrage enemies with powerful attacks. more skilled you are more satisfying Nioh becomes, so get good and have fun."

I can see myself playing all the way through all of the difficulties with this character, and maybe a few more.  When all said and done this will go down as one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm honestly suprised I hadn't heard more about it before a co-worker told me about it.  If you are thinking about getting it, don't, just do it."

If you like fighting games, soulsâ games, or Sekiro, then this is the game for you. Getting to explore a mythical feudal Japan had potential if the game had map design similar to Sekiro, however, unfortunately the maps tend to be repetitive with skins and texture while also tunnel/maze like."

I was crying at the end, asking when it's over.... the last boss is even worse 0.o a fight with absolutely no mechanics other than running round trying to encourage the AI to hit giant rocks....it just feels like a game that was thrown together.... like you're making a cake and instead of being gracious and folding the ingredients in properly you just throw it in a blender instead... I had to uninstall. This game is about as much fun as taking a cheese grater to your face."

If you're looking for a game to which you can devote well over a hundred hours of the only life you'll ever have, you'd have to work very hard to find a more enjoyable, more engaging, and more deserving title.  Though, if you opt to keep looking and stumble across a game that does, in fact, allow you save your favorite convenience store clerk, I'd appreciate a ping; those people are the unsung heroes of the beef jerky and soda world."

It's hard to describe Nioh without mentioning Dark Souls, but it isn't a ripoff, it's a great game with great combat system, more fast paced and intriguing story. The game's pacing is very well done and offers enough rewards to offset it's difficulty. The feeling of beating tough boss after multiple tries is intoxicating especially after you gain the rewards for all your troubles. It's fun to see genuine Japanese historical figures in a world of demons and spirits. It's definitely a lot to absorb at first but its never enough to make you feel overwhelmed by the experience."

If you like diablo style loot, the feeling of darksouls but the combat of a fighting game then this is the game you should try, although maybe the second nioh first as its a prequel and actually better. Do get prepared to be continually blocked by human combatants."

You will spend more time managing items in the menus than actually playing the game(if you care about min maxing atleast). My biggest gripe is the RNG and the grinding needed to get a specific item you want. Every time you make or advance an item, the results you get are random meaning that you just spent 2 hours grinding for loot only to end up with an item you dont need."

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

Scrolling through your inventory and getting rid 90% of your loot is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dumb, why does it even exist if you're gonna discard it anyway? Game is just straight up boring if it comes to level design or lacks any atmosphere. For the past 5 hours I've been running either in some dumb caves, or dark villages. I can understand that devs strived for some gritty atmosphere but this game is just straight up unpleasant to look at and most of the levels feel and look just the same."

It would appear that sometimes if the controller lost signal briefly to the computer, the game would hitch, but usually come back after a second or two. After switching back to a wired controller, I no longer had any crashes. Not saying that was the cause, but it's what worked for me."

It is damn tough from time to time but if you are used to this genre that is exactly what you expect( challenge). There are some unofficial patches to fix widescreen resolution and it works decent. Play the game with the controller (extremely recommended) as tutorial doesn't show keyboard input and you will be lost from the beginning."

It doesn't have the right risk/reward balance, and doesn't level the player's sense of achievement out as well with the sense of loss and failure inherent in a soulslike. It tends to be more on the infuriating side, with too many battles relying on one hit kills and environmental hazards to make them difficult. I would go so far as to say that this game is a health hazard for some people and should be used in caution, as it will tatter your nerves and disappoint you with it's downright and consistent unfairness and bitter taste left in your mouth when you do finally beat a boss..."

Some of the bosses are well-designed and give immense sense of accomplishment when defeated, some of the mechanics are really interesting and shed a new light on a well-known concept. And if you are a hoarder, Nioh has plenty of equipment for you to loot and upgrade. Nevertheless, as a whole, not recommended - the bad parts bring enough frustration to overshadow the good ones. Maybe Nioh 2 will fix some of them - although, judging from watching gameplay streams and videos, it didn't really."

Multiplayer is a lot easier than souls as you can connect with friends before you load into the level and run it with them and it makes the gameplay change a little. The bosses are well designed and have plenty of move sets. If you like a challenge pick it up you wonât regret it."

Its ninja gaiden style action but with more rpg stuff, and more grounded and versatile combat. Imagine ninja gaiden with a stamina bar! It takes some getting used to but its so interesting and a great twist on an action rpg. Expect a bit of a learning curve, it took me about six hours just to beat the first area/boss, and get aquianted with the stances and managing stamina."

The game goes pretty well until the sixth island (and the DLCs after that), when it becames disgustingly unbalanced. Most of the bosses one-shots you with more than half of their attacks, even if you're wearing top-notch medium armor with good toughness. And the missions get unfairly high difficulty rating towards the end, nowhere near your current character level, even if you beat all the side quests along the way. I played it all the way to the end (except the DLCs, which was just utter bulls***), it was alright, but it will never be a true souls-like game, because those are at least fair 'till the end. I still recommend it, because it deserves the attention."

Loved their twist on histroical events and the amount of detail put into item descriptions for historical purposes. A good chunk of the game takes place during or around the Battle of Sekigahara which is my favorite time during the Sengoku Period. Most the respective officers during that time are there, but I had hoped to see Takatora Todo (You can choose his clan in the Clan Battles at least). The Amount of Armor and Weapon designs is truly apprciated, and each combat style between all the weapons for Low-Mid-High Stances. Bosses can be pretty difficult sometimes, multiplayer is fun, and the story is really interesting IMO. I can't wait for the second one!"

As a long time FromSoft fan, I was drawn to Nioh back before it launched as a PlayStation exclusive. I participated in both the Alpha and Beta programs and became more excited at the prospect of a Sengoku-era Dark Souls with each passing hour of playtime I accrued. When it finally launched I decided to hold off until the time felt right, eventually not picking it up until much later for PC. While I can't say I enjoyed every hour I sunk into this title, by the end I felt its pros outweighed its cons. Give it a shot if it seems like your thing, just be prepared to consider anger management after the credits roll."

I have even installed this on a PC with Intel/Nvidia hardware after believing it may be an AMD issue with no luck. The game becomes randomly unplayable with hard crashes and crashes to desktop that always include memory violation errors. I ended up well beyond the refund window simply because of cut scenes and believing an early 5 hour bug free stretch meant that I was okay. I ended up rebuying the game on PS4 and have loved it there. Do not buy this on PC, you have been warned."

There is so much replay value with all the different builds, not to mention way of the strong (ng+). I played alot of demons souls, ds 1 and 2 so this game was very easy for me to get into. Sometimes i think i actually prefer Nioh's combat because of how fast and fluent it is. To make any progress in the game youll have to trihard (just like any souls title) so keep that in mind. 100% recommend i love this game <3"

Honestly its different enough that it can be considered its one thing. The combat is fun and the gameplay is addicting. Its loot system is like Diablo and Borderlands where you progress through the game and get more powerful purely from the gear that you collect rather than your levels. So be prepared for some grinding if you want to have an easier time. The problem with the game comes from the latr difficulties (NG+) While the first playthrough is piss easy IMHO the later difficulties get SO cheap and full of BS that the only way to progress is by insane grinding to get specific items and builds. In general getting one shotted or two shotted in this game is so common that you will scream â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at every death. Not helping that the AI blatanly input reads your commands and reacts accordingly or that the DLCS have some hugely BS bosses with nanosecond attack strings. As a souls lover if you are trying out this game USE EVERY TOOL the game provides you and dont be afraid to cheese and use BS tactics to win cause the game does it too."

Definitely play this one first, it's a great game on it's own, but what it does is it creates the groundwork for the near-perfection that is Nioh 2, you will appreciate and love Nioh 2 because of Nioh."

The game is HARD, but FAIR and REWARDING. Much more faster paced combat than Souls, but, not similar to Sekiro Shadows Die Twice. Think Ninja Gaiden having a baby with Dark Souls and Nioh being the result. I highly recommend this game!"

However, this game reuses a lot of the same few enemies and the levels aren't that great. I usually found myself just rushing to the boss without much care for the level leading up to it, although finding shortcuts to the shrines were very satisfying. Be prepared to be running back to the boss over and over again because the bosses are unforgiving and kill you in 2-3 hits, so one mistake will cost you your life, but thankfully the bosses are very close to the shrines, especially if you have shortcuts leading to it unlocked."

Yes, it's soulslike without the lore or incredible level design; yes, it's overburdened with options to enhance, learn and modify stuff; yes, the story is borderline incomprehensible for a long time; yes, levels are recycled for side missions. But: The fighting mechanics are unparalleled! The system is easy to learn but complex at heart. It's neither button smashing nor ultra complex combos, it's mostly extremely precise timing aided by super responsive controls. You always know what you're doing - or should be doing. Each death is earned. After 120 hours I still can't stop playing although my game library screams for me to do other stuff. Nioh is great and if you like 3rd person fighting and own a controller (you MUST play with a controller) do yourself a favor and try this."

You can become entirely invincible by saving your amrita items for when you need a spirit form crutch. Often times the boss mechanics border on the insane, and always lean more towards tedious than you'd like. If you're desperate for a souls susbstitute. Go for it. It's not bad, you'll just find yourself longing for the less linear and grind based action of any souls entry. If you're a fan of Bloodborne and find the other Souls series combat to slow, this game is fast paced enough to keep you engrossed."

You will know if you like it before the 2 hour refund period is up so XD. ALSO FOR PEOPLE COMING FROM DARK SOULS LIKE ME- this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ must!!! It isn't really even that similar  but the feel is, and that alone is a reason for anyone coming from the souls games to get into it! I think the combat in Nioh is actually far ahead of and far more complex and enjoyable than any of the souls games. The story and lore is not near the level of the souls games but still on a level that makes you curious and care. Overall i'd probably give this game about a 8.5/10, it's truly worth the buy!"

Not to mention every time you get hit by ANYTHING you're stuck in place with absolutely no recourse, so like I said you get combo'd to death constantly. I wanted to like this game so much, but I haven't been able to play it without getting infuriated within the first 4 missions of the game. People say the game feels snappy and responsive but I feel like I'm always getting stuck in place. The looting stuff and all the cool unique gear you can get is awesome, but if you want a game that actually has good combat just play Sekiro."

            "Comment": "This is a fantastic Souls-like game, with an incredibly fast and intricate combat system that leaves even Bloodborne in the dust. The challenge is immense, the gameplay is extremely satisfying, the bosses are challenging, and it's a great way to get that Souls-like fix for people tired of the original series. My only issues are that the balancing is kind of off, with enemies having way too much health and doing way too much damage half the time, and also that the game lacks in variety. There is no open world to explore. Many missions just reuse areas from previous ones, and it can get pretty grating going to the same place all the time. Enemies also are repeated very often. Almost too often. It gets tiring dealing with the same set of dudes over and over and over. However, when the game is fun, it is beyond worth playing. A great time, if a bit repetitive."

Not much light, almost every map is like a maze and most of the stats and features do practically nothing unless you grind mindlessly and have maxed out on key stats OR you decide to play the ninja/mage route which too; is unrewarding.  Not as straight forward as Dark Souls 3 which was more about skill issue but not as painful as all these extra obstacles put in this game let alone the important aspect that changes your game play drastically, which is the camera and lock on feature when targeting. Overall, interesting game."

If you love Japanese Mytholog such as Yokais and Historical figures sprinkled with wonderful combat, this game is for you. The game is more like Ninja Gaiden with the difficulty of Dark Souls. You're gonna die, a lot but you'll also win a lot. Its up to your skill and weapons you use and how good you are with them. Sure there are some performance issues but those didn't really bother me all that much. 8.5/10. I so hope that Nioh 2 will Improve uppon what's already there and then some! Would love to have like this Oni form like in the Trailer (Reminds me of Devilman) also more Yokai to fight against and maybe be-friend as well!"

Most of the NPCs don't do anything besides talk in cutscenes: the game introduces them, forgets about them and later gives an exposition of their story and that's it. The only saving grace is that it is based on actual Japanese history."

The stance system makes for using offensive and defensive strategies interchangable on the fly for adaptable combat. Overall, the gameplay is superb. The port, however, is subpar. The game has problems with 1920x1080 resolution native fullscreen and the game is geared towards controller-based gameplay. It's possible to play with a keyboard and mouse but scripts are needed. Please fix this port because the gameplay deserves a functional game :("

The story of the game is pretty interesting and it isnt just, smaurai/ninja dark souls, the game offers its own unique form of combat in its stance change and living weapon systems and has a very balanced comabt system that allows for the player to decide what way of play thye woud like to do. My only real complaints about this game is its multiplayer, because the way in which you are able to play with a friend is kind of dumb, and the fact that it uses a launcher but other than those two the game runs well, is stable, and is honeslty one of my picks for most fun games of 2017."

            "Comment": "What keeps Nioh from reaching the hights of the game it so clearly wants to emulate (Dark Souls) is its strict adherence to strange mechanics from DS that don't carry over to this game very well.  While the games combat system (involving 3 main stances that drastically change how each and every weapon handles) is pretty unique and quite rewarding to master, this game is so needlessly covered in endless game-design word-salad that I don't feel it's worth it.  Inclusions such as bafflingly steep enemy damage (many enemies will just one-shot you with attacks that have little to no telegraph), EVERY ITEM being strictly limited (and, for the most part, one time use), and the broken Mission system that essentially allows the player to soft-lock the game at any time by picking a mission that's too hard and not being able to leave, make many sections of this game a chore.  To note, Yes, you CAN leave a mission in this game, but it is tied to a limited resource that you CANNOT get more of within a level.  This game isnât Dark Souls hard, it's just unfair.  I have not finished Nioh, and I donât plan on doing so as this game becomes progressively less interesting as it requires me to repeat missions for better loot so I can even have a chance at completing the main story areas.  I can only really recommend this if you've played EVERY Fromsoftware action RPG and REALLY need more of that souls-like sweetness, and even then, just play Jedi Fallen order."

            "Comment": "Best description for this game would be GaidenSouls. Nicely fills the void of not having a SoulsBorne game to play. It is unique enough that it's not a complete rip off of the SoulsBorne formula and in fact expands on the combat system magnificently, with a little flavor of Tenchu. It's not just about RB/RT etc, and the stance mechanic is very rewarding once you find your favorite weapon(s) and really learn it's moveset. The variation of builds is almost endless and players are not limited by excessive (or oppressive) RNG. THE ONLY downside to this game is that it is arranged into \"Missions\", instead of an open seamless world like Dark Souls or Bloodborne, and there is no Invasion mechanic. Instead, players can summon Revenants, AI controlled \"Invader\" shades of dead players, including their skills and gear; killing them actually rewards you with the equipment they are wearing! 9/10"

The biggest issue for me with the game was mostly enemy variation. You are fighting these same demons over and over again which got very boring at some point for me atleast. The game has a lot of stuff to play if u gonna play all sub missions and DLC also. I can totally recommend Nioh for people who like 3rd person hack&slash games and japanese setting!"

Enemies are unreasonable at first but are more than tolerable later. This game is not for the light-hearted. You will be discouraged early on. You will struggle, die, learn, adapt, and repeat until you are victorious. This cycle will reward the competent with a sense of accomplishment and make the rest quit early in the game.  I give this game an 8/10, on par with my rating for Dark Souls III."

Some players have expressed that only builds centered around specific, often rarer, skills or weapons feel truly viable, especially in the face of the sequel's amped-up difficulty. This aspect could lead to a more linear experience, potentially dampening the spirit of exploration and experimentation that fans found so appealing in the original game."

Maybe if I didn't play Nioh 2 before this, it might have been great but I just don't feel like I want to play Nioh 1 let alone finish it. If you haven't played Nioh 2 then this is a good start but if you don't want to invest hundred of hours in both game then just buy Nioh 2."

            "Comment": "Very intruiging and engaging game! The difficulty is there, however, it is not lasily cheap where luck becomes a big factor. The level design is great and encourages exploration, not sticking to a linear path. The loot system is similar to Diablo III or the Borderlands series. For the comparison to the Soulsborne series, it is relatively similar. There are MANY differences which set this game out from the others. The combat is much more fluid and fast paced. Combos are a big part of battles and must be utilized safely and correctly to effectively deal with enemies. The loot system is vastly different with several rarities for items. Overall a very fun game, it even comes with all DLC in this edition!"

The biggest one one is that most of the time it takes a long time to find a match.  It's not a lack of people playing coop either. When you finally get in one you can tell the person has been searching for a visitor for a long time (they are far from the shrine and lots of stuff is dead already)."

            "Comment": "With all that in mind, I still wanted to explore more of the game, since the combat has a nice rhythm to it and I was curious about seeing more of the bosses. The art direction there is really great, everything looks decent for a 2017 game, and the sound effects and ambiance were solid. The rhythm of combat feels pretty good once you start to get a handle on the different weapons, stances, defensive movements, and how those square against the regular enemy types and mini-bosses, but for me that wasnât nearly enough to justify anymore time with Nioh. This game clearly needed me to âgit gudâ to experience it properly, but the glass ceiling of my own skill is just too low for that to happen."

Finished the game on PS4 when it came out and spent 120+ hours. Every minute was worth it. I still bought it on steam cause its a no brainer having the game so as well as the well-made DLCs."

Doesn't waste my time with aimless wandering, has plenty of secrets that are reasonably discoverable (i.e. none of this 'indistinguishable hidden walls' bullcrap that require you to hit EVERY wall just to make sure you didn't miss anything - Nioh's hidden walls have a little more ... personality to them), great combat, love the inventory system, not the best PC controls porting (it still shows X-box buttons, so you have to do a mental mapping to the actual keyboard key, but I found stance-switching with specific hotkeys a hell of a lot more fluid on KBM than a Controller), but once you get the hang of it, its just an absolute blast to play. Can't recommend this game enough to someone who wants a more casual-friendly Souls-like that won't hesitate to challenge you and give you opportunities to excel."

The looting system is â¥â¥â¥â¥ aswell. You finally killed a big boss after 20 tries and get blue items. But the little dweller drops two purple ones. Also the items are limited. You will get the same items but with a higher level. Thats the game. Same enemies, same weapons, same armors and ofc the same levels but sometimes backwards or with harder enemies."

Besides that I'm enjoying the hack n slash gameplay with souls-like elements, and I love the stance mechanic."

            "Comment": "I don't have a lot to say here. The game has a lot of good things going for it. Combat is fast, responsive and satisfying. Armor and weapons are just as unique as in Dark Souls, especially due to the fact that the player can wield these weapons in different stances. I'm indifferent to the Ki mechanic, I guess to me it just seems kind of unnecessary. Level design is smart. Enemies are fun to fight, aside from the lack of variety. Most bosses are good fights, if not somewhat easy. Unfortunately, what ruined this game for me is the copy+pasted enemies, bosses and levels. Like I said before, all three of those things are good in their own right, but when they are shoved down the player's throat over and over again, it's hard not to get sick of it. I might like a steak once a week, but not for every meal. Farming revenants is also an incredibly annoying way to aquire new gear. Revenant fights are the same every singe time, no matter what weapon they are using, so of course it's going to get boring after the first few fights. I understand the implementation of a rarity based loot system is due to the fact that there are only 7 weapon types in the game, but I believe it could have been executed in a better way, without having the game become a total grind-fest. I would recommend getting the game on sale, but don't go into this game expecting it to be of the same caliber as FromSoftware."

At this point you either continue and it will feel like playing Elden Ring without upgrading or spend hours farming levels and better gear. Whats worse game already feels very repetitive and boring before that point. Game is no longer skill game, it's just grinding fest with terrible inventory system."

The game is divided into separate levels and missions, and the loots are like in an Hack'n Slash game. The artistic direction is really \"special\" in a bad way, but the story and setting are really cool. Enemies and bosses are nice to discover even if the bestiary is not very big with a lot of reuse and color swap... Honestly to choose, play Sekiro instead."

Additionally, the combo variety with stances makes aggressive play pretty engaging and interesting (rather than just timing a massive i-frame every few hits right against the boss's leg). I feel like all the weapon classes were given love in terms of balance. The game has a lot of goofy cute guardian spirits, including neon blue and pink doggies."

Many creeps spawned in cluster, mini bosses spawned in cluster, even in some mission you have to deal with 2 bosses at the same time. Most of the boss fights take place in such a narrow area, it's very common to stuck in some decorations when dodging and got hit in the face. Bosses are also been overused, old bosses will be used as mini bosses in the next map not just once but multiple times. The creeps are the same, it just have a few typical enemies for some maps, the game just mix them together to make new level. I don't know if the devs are lazy or something. The last thing will be the key bindings, it's true that the key bindings is the real boss of this game. I play this game with mouse and keyboard but it just display controller key icon when interact with something. I wonder if anyone can play this game with the default key bindings, I've tried and it is a true nightmare. That's why I have to use another settings for mouse and keyboard in the forum, and I have to get used to it from the beginning. It was a very tough time for me to get used to the game control."

Its not dark souls, its not even close to dark souls, Nioh is its own thing and i promise you there will be no games that look at Nioh for their inspiration. For what its worth, i don't hate this game anymore. I'm enjoying my time but look forward to seeing the credits roll. I hear Nioh 2 is far better, so atleast i can put that on my wishlist and not regret it."

There's heaps of screenshots and comparions floating around showcasing the downgrades, there's alot more inventory management and gear micro-management in this title than I originally thought but it's nothing un-manageable. I love this time era and style and am genuinely hyped for Nioh 2 and Ghost of Tsushima but I honestly hope Nioh 2 becomes a PS4 exclusive. Or if they are going to bring it to PC again, they really need to make the game seperate from the console version."

            "Comment": "This is one of the very few game's which i would consider Souls like but in my eyes is completely better than dark souls. Now I love Dark Souls, it's on the top of my list as a great game series but Nioh is on track to surpass it. It's gameplay is both challenging and rewarding, being able to kill something twice your size and coming out unscathed is one of the best feelings this game has to offer. The weapon's in nioh feel great to use all of them with their own play styles and movesets. The actual story could be better but with alot of the Japanese characters the voice acting is spot on as well as the character details as well. I won't explain the story as you need to experience it yourself but if you like dark souls then this game is a must play for anybody looking for a challenge and different type of story."

Youd be better off playing quite literally any other soulslike for the same dopamine rush, without the 10s of hours spent tilting, which will certainly happen no matter how good u are. Not really worth it imo and i kinda regret playing, feels like i wasted so much time and didnt even have fun"

The presentation, level design, boss design, class builds, all shine with the same familiar quality any Dark Souls player would expect, but what's really exceptional about Nioh is that it doesn't just dwell on this successful imitation, it goes all out innovating too. Weapon stances, combos, ki, yokai realm, special spirit modes, it adds so much over the basic framework of a \"Souls-like\" it makes itself both instantly familiar but also unique. A must play if you're a fan of the genre!"

I feel it is a particularly worthwhile game at USD$30, but you could probably reach the second level before where all the tutorial stuff is done before the 2 hours are up, so don't be afraid to try it out even at full price."

Played it solely for completing all main content and DLC and defeating every boss. I recommend this game even though my love/hate relationship for it at times. There were many moments of cursing and pounding my fist into the table out of frustration due to what I perceived as outrageous defeats. However, as I persisted and evaluated the boss patterns and my approach to them I found success. The game has a lot of cool looking armor and weapons, lore, and cutscenes. My final point - I didn't master the game crafting system or fully grasp the set bonuses. Lots of keywords and bonuses that were hard to understand or navigate through especially using a keyboard/mouse setup. The one thing I disliked most was the level were I had to fight a bunch of spiders! Gave me goosebumps!"

Reusing enemies and bosses, flat level design and boring and broken story make this a no for me personally. I understand the combat is very deep but I just don't have the will to learn it. A lot of people love this game so play if you're interested. Just for me personally it's a no."

And the story of William a foreigner in a country that swells with war and demons it creates was pretty interresting to watch. So to sum up we have a good and hard game definitely worth its price."

Nioh does both of these beautifully. It wears it's soulsborne influence on it's sleeve and nails everything that makes those games to beloved. Level design, difficulty scaling and player control are all top notch and feel right out of a From title- however Nioh isn't content to just make a feudal japan flavored souls game. It introduces an interesting mission based structure that allows the devs to remix all levels upon completion with interesting new challenges and side missions, and the H/M/L stance system allows you to have a wide variety of combat options regardless of the weapon you decide to invest skill points in. Overall a fantastic game that has skyrocketed it's sequel to one of my most anticipated titles of 2020"

            "Comment": "Most likely there was good lot of that forgot to waddle about, as Nioh has surprising amount of stuff going for it. For example did acknowledge that there is backstab thingy existing quite early on, still it did take very long time to find it from Ninja Arts section and it only cost 1 point. Had a silent moment, after all was already at 8 out of 9 regions in of the game. Only didn't do last areas side mission with 2nd last and last boss and then the human mob with ninja and samurai at the end, as was starting to had enough of those. Overall feel like it was really neat experience, but honestly think it's easily most frustrating souls game have ever played due the dmg numbers which are obnoxious and totally unbalanced. Nioh 2 apparently is better in this regard and recommend rather going at it, though can't say for sure, as don't have it or haven't played it, but Nioh is just too badly done in this regards that can't recommend it."

            "Comment": "This game is enjoyable if you only play the game once. New game plus and forward offers no real enjoyment. It all revolves around repetitive grinding, frustrating and cheap deaths, same boring enemies, horrible loot drops, and reused maps. Every time I start a new game plus, I always feel weaker than the last. The sense of progress is none existent, you can still get one shoted by the weakest enemies even with high level gear. I have level 310 (+130) ethereal armor with graces on it and still get destroyed if I make a mistake. The balance in this game is garbage. If you play on higher difficulties get ready to die in 1-3 hits by every single enemy in the game, but if you go back to lower difficulties you 1-3 hit everything. Now the dlc for the game does nothing to solve any of these issues, as a matter of fact it takes the worst parts of the game and turns the dial up by 10. Some maps are reskins of the base game maps. You can count with one hand the number of new enemy types they introduce. Get ready for cheap and headache inducing enemy placement. Oh and don't get me started with the abomination of a map that is siege of osaka winter. The replayability of this game is a real chore because you never seem to get stronger, its only for those that like the tedium of memorizing every single enemy pattern. If you play the game once its really enjoyable, but the more you play the less fun it becomes."

            "Comment": "Nioh is not for everyone, but it is for me. Despite the very tacked-on \"Soulslike\" mechanics, this game follows more in the footsteps of Ninja Gaiden than anything else. Where it fails in comparison to Soulsborne games is in enemy variety, level design, role-playing, loot, world building and atmosphere. Where it succeeds and even surpasses Souldborne is in its incredibly deep, challenging and rewarding combat, character progression, customization, memorable boss fights, and endgame content. This game is somewhat overwhelming with its sheer amount of systems at play. There's weapon proficiency, skill trees, skill/attack combo customization, weapon customization, melee and range weapons divided by tier/rarity, magic, a three stance combat system, Ki management, blessings, attributes, dojo missions to unlock skills and skill upgrades, crafting, transmogs, guardian spirits, prestige points, clans, random twilight missions, and probably much more I'm missing. It's a lot, but given enough time, you'll realize you don't need to memorize all of these things to do well. I went through the latter half of the game underleveled and still was able to beat it without much of a hassle. That said, this game is hard. Much harder than any Souls game and I've played all of them from King's Field to Elden Ring. Attacks are much faster and far more damaging. Most yokai and bosses can knock 80-90% of your health in one hit or combo. You gotta block and you gotta dodge often. Combat is much more skill-based here and you have far fewer i-frames to work with than even Sekiro. Like I said, this is more similar to Ninja Gaiden than Bloodborne. Combat is very brutal. Enemies get dismembered upon death and when you knock their ki(stamina) down to zero, it opens them up to a grapple attack. This is basically the deathblow mechanic from Sekiro, before Sekiro. The three stance system works really well for specific approaches to combat. You want maximum damage at the cost of slower attacks with high ki depletion? You use high stance. You want maximum defence? You use medium stance. You want low ki depletion with faster dodges and attacks at the cost of attack damage? You use low stance. It's quick and easy to switch between the three to maximize combat efficiency. Combos can be customized through the unlocking of skills and each weapon type has its own skill tree. The stamina management of this game is arguably the best of any soulslike game to date because of the ki pulse mechanic where depleted ki can be rapidly recovered through correctly timing the press of a button. Press too early and you only get a fraction back. Too late and you miss your chance. It genuinely becomes second nature after playing for a few hours. The game really suffers in its confusing and forgettable narrative with constant exposition for every boss/NPC you meet and will likely never meet again, and a villain who appears before almost every boss fight just to run away to the next boss fight. Disappointingly enough, he's probably the easiest boss in the game. Enemy variety is nonexistent. You will fight the same zombies, skeletons, soldiers, and handful of yokai over and over again for every single mission. Side missions are a BORE. They often take place in the exact same levels making for a monotonous grind that you don't want to do, but should for the unlocks. Level design is pretty linear which is fine, but is hampered by the forced soulslike design of having shortcuts for levels that are just too small with too little enemy variety. There's no reason to explore really given the fact that loot is randomized and there's no reason to revisit a level either. Speaking of loot, expect to have to clean up your inventory after every damn mission since you are bombarded with junk loot that's just going to be sold or disassembled. Less is sometimes more. Putting all of that aside, this is one of the few examples of a soulslike that escapes from the shadow of its inspiration by doing something unique and better in some ways. If you're looking for a great action game with decent RPG mechanics, this is your game."

The only real nitpick i could have is that you put so much into all the skills you get toward your fighting style and some just don't work against the harder enemies. Demons aren't effected by some; whatever the point though, beating some of the harder enemies gives you that same thrill you get from finally taking down a boss in Dark Souls. Though it may take a while to get used to the strange style of the game's combat system, once you get used to it you'll wonder why more games don't try it, and part 2 was even better with more emphasis on the combat system and more weapon types to choose from. Just for a little cherry on top of this triple fudge cake, dismembering an enemy as he does his final death fall is viscerally satisfying."

Keep in mind that I have never beaten any Dark Souls games, have beat Sekiro three times, and Elden Ring once. That's my experience with these types of games. I hope my review has helped you make a decision on buying Nioh. I just purchased it on sale because I wasn't sure I would enjoy it, but I really will be playing more in the near future."

I recommend playing them in order so you can really appreciate the QoL improvements Nioh 2 makes, but rest assured, if you have even a love in challenging and mechanically deep action games like DMC and Ninja Gaiden this is the kind of game you will ADORE."

If your are an old-school player that loves his grinding, epic boss fights with crazy difficulty (and moments of frustration) and samurai-era Japan (Sengoku Jidai), this game is for you. The overall depth of the game, its fluid and deep combat system, the epic fights and armours, and the overall depth of all gameplay elements should be a staple for any RPG these days, no excuse. One of the best aspects of the game for me is how smooth and responsive the controls are for both movements and attacks. I played the entire game with keyboard and mouse and I can say it works perfectly if you find it more convenient than a controller."

This game goes FAR beyond the \"souls-like\" label and honestly, it's better than any of the Souls games by a long shot. There, I said it -- now play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game!!"

But it captures the essence of what makes FromSoftware's combat feel so good. And Nioh's combat feels good, responsive, and rewarding. As for story, it takes inspiration from real life history and keeps it simple and clean. It does not try to be something deep or complex. And I think that works to its benefit. The same with the characters. The story and characters act as a simple and elegant vessel for the lovely combat. My personal suggestion is, if it is available at a discount then it is a must buy for anyone who loves FromSoftware's games, and want more. Just be sure to look up the basics of combat if you are struggling, as I think the tutorial is not the best."

Death will kiss you each and every moment until you get the high rated gears like Dark Souls and  attack styles make you eager to kill enemies like Devil May Cry. Each and everything is best in this game. Best value for the money. Give it a try."

Anyway, even if you didn't try ds-like games before, but like japanese setting with samurai/youkai and do not afraid of some difficulties - you should try it, imo =)"

A lot of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ is less present in the main game and more present in the DLC. I give the main game a 9/10, and I give the DLC a 7/10. Together that's an 8/10 so it's still recommendable. I hear Nioh 2 is better and I am much awaiting its arrival to steam."

It gets quite difficult when you get past the Way of the Samurai but playing with a friend that is a higher level is really helpful. If you like running around as a samurai and slashing your opponents to death as I do then you will love this game. Nioh is also a good game for people who like challenges as there is quite a bit of customization. One of my favorite challenges in this game is the Dark Souls no armor challenge whereas it states you take off all your armor which requires you to be able to dodge all of your enemy's attacks if you don't feel like dying every three seconds. All in all, I recommend this game to anyone that thinks they might enjoy it even in the slightest. Have fun and don't die too much."

I'm over 50h in now and I can say that I'd wholeheartedly recommend it any time it's on sale, asking price is a little much. The game feels very rough if you're coming from darksouls because while they look very similar they have some sharp differences. I struggled through the first 15h of the game before realizing that you cant dodge most attacks and blocking is mandatory. It starts off pretty slow and narrow, but the more you play the more the game opens up and lets you customize how you want to play. Side note, people keep comparing this game to PoE. I have an unhealthy amount of time playing PoE and I can guarentee they are NOTHING alike, I have no idea why people keep saying this. If you come in looking for a PoE experience you will be dissapointed."

Firstly you should be aware that the game is sort of chapter based and you'll be skipping from one level to another. The levels themselves are ok, but some are reused for side missions with the only difference being altered enemies and added gimmicks. The thing instead to look for in this game is the amazing combat. Unlike Dark Souls you'll have three stances you can switch to at your whim altering your attacks and movement. To go along with this is a very rewarding stamina management system, forcing your opponent to run out of their \"ki\" will open them up to devastating attacks. But you must be wary of the same thing yourself and strike a balance between defense and offense to keep up. Lastly the story is nothing special to wright about, so get this on sale, you won't be disappointed."

Unlike Dark Souls where you mostly focus on a specific build, Nioh gives you the liberty to build your arsenal with different spells and ninjutsus, that can vary the playstyle depending on the challenge ahead of you. You might find yourself using more ninjutsus on certain levels along with ranged weapons, and other more Yokai focused levels you'll feel the need to use spells. It's not as hard as Dark Souls, but in a good way, where you can easily craft a better strategy to beat all kinds of enemies. Definitely recommended. Tons of replayability."

There are some many ways to modify you equiptment that it wouldnt make sense to list them all in a review just watch guides on youtube for it. I personally dont like it at all. Sure it does enable more builds but it dosent have to be so grindy, RNG based and complicated. The difficulty of the game is also heavly influenced by how well you are at managing your gear."

There some factors that makes it similar e.g. amrita is like souls in dark souls and you have shrines that are like bonefires and you have your character leveling attributes similar to dark souls. and thats it. Rest of the game is totally different. Combat styles and options are very vast. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend. Developers could have done a better job at porting this game to pc but the game itself is worth every penny."

            "Comment": "A great game with flaws that I would recommend to anyone that enjoys action games and RPGs. The combat is in depth and enjoyable. You are allowed to customize your move set which is augmented by weapon type and stances. The story is mediocre but it has some moments of charm. Throughout the game the music creates a consistent tone and does the heavy lifting to keep the player interested in the world. If you are adverse to random loot drops then this game might not be for you. However, the loot is done well; you actually have a lot of control over what you get and you can customize the stats and appearance of your equipment. On a technical level the game did crash quite a bit at a certain point, but the game saves often and the load times are fast enough that I didn't mind. The game is also a bit heavy on the side quests but if you push through it there is a fun and rewarding game to be had. There are plenty of reasons to replay it. Each new game plus offers new mechanics and you can easily try out different builds."

The game can quickly feel very repetitive for many players. However, for players looking to get longevity out of their purchase, as well as those interested in mastery over the game mechanics, Nioh presents great value."

Anyway if you keep your mind open and temper expectations, this can be a good experience for both souls-born and diablo gamers alike."

The narrative here is far more obvious than in a Souls game and the combat has a uniqueness with the stance-change mechanic in addition to the various combinations of weapons which makes fighting enemies feel fast and fluid, which is a nice and appreciated change. This game is still difficult, and I haven't played that much of it yet having only gotten past the first four bosses, but there is still lots of game left to play and the difficult increases as you progress. Definitely worth checking out, and I don't like to write reviews that often because that's gay...so buy Nioh."

Story is all over the place and hard to track. Setting and design is beautiful. Combat is fast and You have to stay focus. Like in souls You will die a lot and then die a lot but it made me fell less frustrated. You feel that dying is actually your fault not the fact that mechanics and clunkines plays against You. Good pick in my opinion."

            "Comment": "In this game, you will die... a lot. After getting used to game mechanics, learn the combat system, experience some enemy types, you will still die a lot. After mastering some difficult fighting techniques, you can get an advantage over your enemies, but get too cocky and you dead. Two or three hits from the enemy (depends on the armor type you wear) an you will get a nice death screen dÃ©jÃ  vu. This game can really teach some patience, an opportunity for this \"one open\" to attack. Combat system is quite standard for those games, we get two attacks: light and heavy, three stance: low, medium, high for use and change in any moment and various types of weapons. As you can see this combat system gives you many variables to experiment with. The story isn't really nothing special, but its solid background for balanced gameplay and excuse to kill many yokai demons. If you like very challenging role-playing combat games, well you can't get wrong with this one. It's even more recommendable if you like dark fantasy Japan style :)"

Currently; Bloody fantastic. Likely to continue to be; Bloody fantastic. If you prefer your Souls to be Dark or your Blood to be Borne you'll like your Oh to be Ni'd. Buy it. Even at full price of $50, it's certainly worth it. Assuming things don't suddenly go drastically wrong with the endgame, I give it a 9.5/10"

            "Comment": "There are a ton of reviews for this game on Steam that give more articulate feedback than I can so I'm going to address my review to a very specific audience - Bloodborne fans.  After playing through Bloodborne a few times and absolutely loving it, I found myself wanting something new to play that was made in the same vein.  I tried the Souls games but I didn't care for the slow combat so I gave this one a shot.  I can happily report that if you just happen to be like me in that you were looking for a game that scratches that Bloodborne itch, this one scratches it nicely.   It's definitely its own game but the similarities are there.  The combat is aggressive and the Ki pulse system reminds me of the rally system from Bloodborne, only it restores Ki (stamina) instead of health so you can just keep going.  The loot is diablo styled so a lot of it won't see any use past selling or offering, but at least it's something different.  It's not a perfect game but it's definitely a good one."

            "Comment": "Nioh is a good game. Nothing more, nothing less. The combat system is fluid, versatile, this is where newest Koei Tecmo's title really shines. Actually, Nioh ruined Dark Souls combat for me, which now seems sluggish and slow...it's just hard to come back to DkS after playing this. All the other aspects of the game - graphics, sound, world design etc. - are just decent. The worst thing about Nioh is that it quickly becomes repetitive and recycling of monsters and levels in later missions is very noticeable. It lacks visual diversity, atmosphere of secrecy and deep lore, in some places it's even dull and uninspired. Story is also rather meh...Subsequent playthroughs are not worth it - just simple grind fests with a bit of frustration. In a nutshell, buy it if you like difficult, fast action games, just don't expect Soul's or Bloodborne's level of greatness, Nioh is nowhere as tight or addicting."

It's also mission based instead of one open world. I really adore the setting it's in and the unique Japanese mythology. Gameplay is addictive once you get a hang of things and are progressing through it's lengthy campaign and that's even without the post launch dlc which are great as well. On top of that it has a lot of replay value and difficulty challenges once you've completed the base game's story."

I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after all, it's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game. There's no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game. It takes time to grind for resources and build things, but if you can develop patience, that grinding pays off, and the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result."

If you can do both of these things, the game becomes very fun and has something to offer for almost everyone. Also, you should probably find a friend to taxi you around to make your early game bearable."

All those gameplay hours still exist in the game. Nobody took them away. You can still do all the same things they did 'back in the good days'. The only difference is that now there is even more of it and they just got bored of the game AFTER SPENDING 2000 QUALITY HOURS! Can you really blame the game for that? Everyone gets bored of everything eventually, there is no escape from the reality.  Quit for a year like I did. Play something else. Maybe come back, maybe don't. Does not change the fact the game still has all the same amazing content it always had and more."

There are those out there who are complaining about things changing, and I basically say that if the game remained static, or only followed their personal intersts, it wouldn't be any better.. just better for those people who are complaining. Raids were fun for the top teir of players, and no one else. If De had focused on only that, everyone else who wasn't top tier (a much larger number of players) would have been left hanging."

Fun and fast paced non-linear gameplay, with the ability to break up your grind with different gamemodes and activities makes for a very open gameplay loop that doesn't tire you out (unless you're hellbent on one specific thing). Enough collectables and weapons to scratch the looter-shooter itch. Even better with friends. Fantastic dev team and one of the nicest gaming communities I have ever had the pleasure of being a part of."

The combat feels rewarding, the customization feels rewarding, the MODDING feels rewarding. Compared to Destiny, Warframe makes you feel powerful. Nothing is paid for, you can grind for everything you need and that is the best thing a free to play game can offer. There is also an in-game MARKET DEVELOPED BY THE COMMUNITY that lets you trade in-game items for the games premium paid currency. However, this game has a terrible sense of guidance for new players so it's recommended you look up guides to see what you must do to progress. Have fun!"

But as the years went by and with less to do after finishing every achievement, quest and grinded all frames and weapons and finished that last MR test, there was nothing left that would keep me in the game more than logging on only to help and guide others. The newer updates are dreadful in my eyes and I feel like the game has lost its touch, so the Warframe I knew and enjoyed I will be forever thankful for and the friends I made during this time, playing and having fun together. But I will never go back fully to it.  I will still give a thumbs up for the old content, it's a game worth trying even though it's a bit hard in the beginning before you figure out how it works."

However you can and will get lost in the early stages at some point. Bring an experienced friend or even guides to help you if things get rough. But don't blindly follow guides. My best experiences in this game were finding them and messing around with builds makes this game so worth it. (At least to me) One more thing to those wondering, should this ever reach the top of the boards, yes there are microtransactions and yes there is paid currency, but you can work for every thing in this game, EVERYTHING. Course the grind is more challenging and the road of the grind will be longer than the lifespan of the universe but you can still work for it. There is a more sinister outlook towards the future of this game. So please, before  it heads down video game dev hell, play it. It's free and it's pretty fun."

This is a game that truly puts almost every triple A game to shame, most other indie games, and every other free to play game. I love this game and I love the people in it, this is probably the most friendly community in any game. I want new players to join this game, and I'm willing to help teach anyone who needs a little help. Anything to get more people into this lovely game. Feel free to contact me about this game if you have any questions."

Naturally Warframe is free to play and thus there is encouragement to purchase Platinum - the in game currency you buy for real money - so that you can expand your arsenal and have greater access to weapons and frames. While normally I wouldn't chastise this business model, in this case I chastise it simply due to how necessary it winds up being, unless you don't mind being a minimalist and being extremely picky with what you keep and what you sell after you rank it to 30. For hoarders like myself, it's a nightmare."

It's easy to fall into a mindset where being efficient means pushing yourself forward unreasonably. I fear that mindset of tolerating the game is what kept me on the hook for so long."

(Iâve seen some multiplayer games sustain themselves with only ~2,000). Thereâs people here, clans to join, channels to chat with, a lot of enemies to shoot and tons of toys to play with. At the very least, it is free to install."

My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

If you do like it and if you feel that you will be playing it in the long run (like how I felt after my first 100th hours), do consider buying a little platinum to expand your weapon and Warframe slots. I bought like 19.90 USD worth of platinums. Not much, but it is the spirit that counts, right?"

Its got an in depth and complicated story, spanning a massive amount of characters and interactions, sub plots and smaller stories that intertwine with each other to make this huge universe. Its gun play, movement, and ability use is satisfying, it blends overpowered weaponry with occasionally challenging gamemodes, and a rewarding atmosphere for a farming mmo. Its community is wonderful and friendly, theres always a few bad apples, as every game has of course! I can confirm this game can be confusing and overwhelming for new players, but I hope those who are interested in this game will 100% give it a shot and experience a game that has been crafted with passion, and memes, by an amazing development team who loves to interact with their community. I'm excited and ready for Warframe's future."

Other than that the game itself is pretty grindly to obtain materials to build items...then you grind again to obtain the parts...then grind again to get the final item and maybe a few more times as DE loves layering the grind lols. Lastly, if you're into cosmetics then you are in for a treat as \"fashion frame\" is another big part of the game; if you do have a lot of extra $$$ laying around of course."

            "Comment": "So let's start from a new players point-of-view. You have unlocked your first planet. You can continue to do the mission-nodes that it has to offer, all the way up to the planet boss. Each planet also has a newly-added feature, which are known as Junctions. Junctions are what players have to go through to get to the next planet, and will offer a variety of trials before passage. Upon completing a Junction, you are rewarded with a few things, such as blueprints for weapons, a few parts for building a few specific warframes, and they will unlock quests. Quests are side-things that you can do, which also give you some rewards. There are a handful of warframes that are quest-exclusive if you want to obtain them, as well as some helpful items to assist you along the way. Another recent addition (as in since December) are Cinematic Quests. These are main story-related quests that have cutscenes, and usually have a lot to reveal about the lore, and will unlock some other nice things (You still have to unlock these quests from Junctions, or even just through the market.) The in-game market shows mostly all of everything you can get in the game. The best part? You can get most of this for free! Of course you can add money to just BUY weapons, warframes, gear, companions, etc., and gain access to them immediately, but this is not a pay-to-win game. Not at all. It's more of a 'pay-to-progress-faster' game. However, building these things by yourself without paying any real currency can be a fun time-consuming process. The word Fun can be taken literally or sarcastically in this subject, depending on what the building requirements are, for what you are making. You gather resources to build and complete these things from different planets throughout the solar system, each having their own set of different resources. They drop from enemies, loot lockers, and storage containers (there is even a warframe that increases loot drops, while simutaneously punching souls and raising the dead!). Also, you can earn the real-money currency in this game by trading with other players. I'm out of space at this point, but all I have to say is I wish more of my friends could get into this."

            "Comment": "However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to potential new players. The on-boarding experience, while improved over the years is still pretty bad. They teach you the gameplay well enough, but then throw you into a frankenstein's monster of systems that they did not put nearly enough effort into explaining. There are also so many vestigial systems. As a new player, you might find yourself pouring in time to understand one of these bastardized systems to only to find out that it's out-dated and been unsupported for years. (looking at you archwings among other things) They really could stand to invest some time and money into improving the onboarding experience for new players. Clean up/remove unused systems, optimize the current ones and create worthwhile tutorials for them. New content is great for us who have played for hundreds of hours, but I feel like they would do themselves more good if they spent some extra time and money on the early game. There is a reason only 40% of players have gotten to the 2 hour mark of this game and this is the biggest reason why. I wish this was a game I could recommend to not only others on steam, but to my friend group. As it stands now, I cannot."

The amount of information as a new player is overwhelming.  But if you can understand its a series of small, bite-sized, dopamine rewards, its so fun.  The story is an amazing complicated maze of political intrigue and alternate realities.  I know people have heard the 100 hour theory or its gets better X hours in.  All of that came from Warframe.   If you enjoy power fantasy and space ninjas, stick with it.  It will slowly reveal itself until you have a mastery of the systems."

No one said it would be easy, but, given time, you can do it. The graphics are fantastic and the controls are very dynamic. Plus, there are a multitude of characters to use based on you play style. Wanna run hardline tank, not a problem. Wanna blitz around spreading misery as quickly as possible, got you covered. Dps, status effects, and many more options are all available. Now, the game can devolve into a bit of a farm-a-thon at times. Find some other people that can help and crack in. I also love how I can put the game down for a little while and pick it back up no problem. All of this in a free to play game that offers a great deal of fun."

It can be buggy, it can be hard to follow at some points, and some of the timers are clearly a relic of the past that refuses to let go... but for every one of these complaints you can find something good. The music is out of this world, the story dares to try something different in this tired world of live service games, and the gameplay is a mix of cool things the devs wanted to see in their game, and that alone makes it worth playing."

It's very slow, and getting a good new weapon could take you upwards of up to 5-10 hours of gameplay, and that's not including the crafting time. Other than that, it is a fantastic free to play game. Even if it was like $20, I would still recommend it. It's a classic, but don't let other people talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ to you if you don't think the game is for you. It is a grindy game, but the grind is pretty fun."

            "Comment": "Warframe has come a long way from when i first started playing, but i can honestly say the majority of it was great! Let me start by describing what warframe is. Its an over the shoulder third-person shooter where you play the role of a ninja warrior in space. The solar system is in chaos, and it's up to you to maintain the balance. With many weapon types to choose from, and different frames to use to suit your playstyle, the possibilities are endless. However there are certain strategies in higher level missions that even veteran players will tell you work. It's pretty much an MMO at this point, so certain \"classes\" of warframes work better at farming resources on certain missions. The developers also release new content as operations to introduce the new features, for example, the newest addition was corpus dropships that drop squads of enemies into battle. It was introduced as Operation: Ambulas Reborn, which featured a reworked boss that dropped in from the ship with a squad of regular enemies. There were a few bugs at first, but the incredibly awesome support team was very quick to respond to reports and get back within 24-48 hours. All in all, this has become one of the best free to play games i have ever played, and the graphics do an excellent job of immersing you in a living, breathing world that is constantly changing. I have to say that there are certain aspects of the game which require you to pay for features. Such as certain weapons, cosmetic packs, etc. Other than that, if you work hard and spend a decent amount of time on it, everything important is attainable without paying money for it. I do encourage you to support the developers by buying things that you may like, but only at your own discretion. Speaking of which, there is also a thriving market for the ingame currency, platinum, where you can spend platinum to buy parts, weapon mods, and other hard to obtain aspects from other players, as well as selling your own parts and mods to other players to obtain platinum. The prices will indeed vary on the rarity of what you are trying to get, but there is also sites and a wiki for any questions you may have about said things. All in all i have had a great experience with this game, rather than reading my long-winded review about the game, why not try it yourself? It's free! Also feel free to add me ingame and i will do my best to be as helpful as possible, my name is Mix_Masterson. See you on the battlefield, and have fun!"

My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\""

If you really REALLY want to play the game, go ahead, but I wouldn't recommend investing too much of yourself into this game."

I have reached the point of the game where all I have left to do is collect a few weapons and cosmetics, in which I have made the money (platinum) for on my own time.  As a high ranking player, I have seen many types of players and many changes throughout the game.  The gameplay and trading in Warframe are merciless to those who start out the game, but provides an interesting learning experience to read the minds of the person on the other side of the screen.  It took me a couple of hours to just figure out the parkour mechanics, and many more to be able to hold my ground against enemies that you may think are stupid at first, but then realize that they are stupid, but hit hard.  Even with the legendary grind this game has striked into players, I remain playing the game, seeing new content put out that never fails to impress.  If you are looking for a game where you can casually spend time with friends, be astounded by the copypasta maps that always hold great beauty, laugh at the funny bugs that can be found on rare occassions, fight for the \"honor\" of the merciless tenno, or find a challenge mastering the game's distinct mechanics and unmatched third-person combat, then I welcome you to join Warframe."

I've invited 4 friends on and only 1 has passed the 50 hour mark. Early game is pretty boring and bad. If anything needs to get updated or fixed its that"

There's a kernel of a fantastic action game with a grand sci-fi story in there, but it's buried under layers and layers of grind, distractions, meaningless time-sinkholes, and unfinished dead ends. That's the most frustrating part about it - everyone who gets deeply into it will have dozens of ideas on how to fix it - because it's obvious that it needs fixing, and that there's something there worth saving."

It is incredibly friendly towards free-to-play, and the premium currency is relatively easy to trade for with warframe.market. Story is also surprisingly intricate and engaging, past any of my expectations for a game of this genre. The main gameplay loop, while very grindy, is a very enjoyable power fantasy experience. New player experience may be overwhelming or confusing, and I suggest watching Youtube videos or finding a long-time player to help guide you."

After completing an early tutorial mission, you'll soon find out that the world of Warframe is much more vast and complex. There are tactics, character nuances and tricks that you'll pick up as you have fun grinding through missions. Every time I launch the game, I learn something new.  I'm thoroughly enjoying my time immersed in this game and I can't believe that this F2P game has so much to offer! Side note: The free to play mechanics are done very well. The game doesn't block you or turn into a snooze-fest just because you don't want to pony up the dough."

Also, check out the marketplace in game from your ship. You will find most blueprints for weapons and warframes, and consumable items there. Infact, many items that have a PLAT pricetag on them in the armory, you will find that the blueprints are on the market and cost credits instead, leaving you to farm the items and craft it yourself. Buying it with PLAT, skips the farming and the crafting. Lastly, except in a few rare cases, it's highly recommended that you leave MatchMaking on PUBLIC. You will find players on at all hours of every day, doing Alerts and farm runs on bosses for WarFrames, as well as farming some missions for vital crafting materials. You never know when you get a full squad to make the mission go much faster. People either don't talk in Squads, or are civil/friendly. I've seen one rude comment ever, that was easily ignored. ))"

Warframe isn't your typical hand-holding experience; it's a challenging grind that rewards dedication with boundless fun. The depth of lore and intricate mechanics may seem overwhelming at first, but once you delve in, it's a solid 10/10 experience. From mastering the parkour-infused combat to crafting and customizing your Warframes and weapons, every moment feels rewarding. While it may not appeal to everyone, those who appreciate its complexities understand why Warframe remains a beloved staple in the gaming community."

Right out of the gate I'm already collecting a bunch of currencies that I have no idea what they're even used for or why I want them. I have to navigate a bunch of menus and windows to keep up with gear instead of just having a simple inventory screen. I'm never sure where I'm supposed to go or why I'm doing it, all I know is there is a thousand different directions I could be going with no clear motivation for picking one path over another. Too many different kinds of upgrades and stats that I need to continually juggle so that I can be viable against the same enemies in a new zone that are arbitrarily stronger even though they look and act exactly the same. Far too much pointless complexity. It feels like if I want to grasp the game I just needed to be there since launch. As it stands now the game feels outright hostile to new players, like it is intentionally trying to confuse and overwhelm you."

            "Comment": "After playing it for 92 days on Xbox and now 300 some odd here on steam, I gotta say Warframe is a pretty good game, could it be better, yes, but you can say that about any game in the world, now that doesn't mean I don't think Warframe needs imporvements, like the constant content drought that happens with the game, or the fact that many updates and new additions to the game are more so tailored to new players, rather than adding true end game content that the veterans that have been playing for thousands and thousands of hours desperately need rather than having to go in and see how long they can make it in a survival because they have simply ran out of things to grind for at a certain point. But even still I always find myself returning to Warframe, as a person who normally doesnt enjoy the full hard grind mmo action style games, because at a certain point I get bored of the repetitive nature of them and want to move onto something else, but Warframe has and continues to be a game that breaks that trend for me, as I started playing back in 2014 after a friend who played the game on pc told me about it and I figured I'd give it a shot, and from there the game had managed to hook me, with its flowing movement system, diverse roster or frames and weapons that you can play with, and the overall level of freedom and power the game lets you feel. And while you can feel the grind while you are working towards increasing your mastery rank, or trying to farm out that last 1000 plastids to get a new weapon, it still feels satisfying to do so, simply because even though the mission type are generally quite similar, the weapons and combat of the game are just fun to play with, whether you run around with a big ass sword and cut down people from the waist, or you use a weapon with the dreaded self damage, just so you can see your enemies get blown sky high. Or you use a punch through tonkor because you want to use an explosive weapon, but you don't want to actually use an explosive weapon. Its all fun to just â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with and see what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can get up to trying out different builds. And all of this just cumulates into an experience that is fun to play and refreshing from the normal monotony that is most grinding mmos. Also DE themselves as a company is fantastic, providing feedback to their community, constantly keeping in touch with us, and making sure we know what they are getting up to, trying their best to keep us happy. So overall I would say its definetly a game to check out, and learn more about, because it appeals to those that enjoy grind games and those that don't."

            "Comment": "Warframe is a incredibly grindy game that often needs lots of time and motivation to complete certain tasks, but it does the grinding in a way that i think can still be fun whether your a new player, a player that's pretty knowledgeable of the game or even a veteran player since day 1.The grinding can most definitely be time consuming and sometimes tedious but i think the reward and feeling you get for completing something you have been working towards is amazing and very gratifying. Warframe isn't the game for everyone but i believe if you are looking for a long term game it is definitely a good pick. In total, i do really think Warframe is a good and unique game with all its systems, modding, playstyles and the (somewhat) wholesome community there is to find. I hope this review helps you decide whether to get funny space robot ninja game or not. adios."

Microtransactions exist but you can get everything in the market, apart from some cosmetics, through gameplay or even trading with other people. No content is locked behind a paywall either which is pretty nice. Fair warning tho, this game is a huge time sink and will eventually give you a god complex to the point you'll start itching if you don't manage to kill everything on the map within 2 seconds. There's also the super heavy RNG based farming which can also be very annoying at times. Good game to play tho especially while listening to music or watching something on the side."

            "Comment": "First off, let me say I have another 2,400 hours (about 1,500 in missions) on the PS4 version of this game. I have been around since the beginning of this game. I very much so enjoy playing this game with my friends, it can be a great, enjoyable time. However, Digital Extremes makes it harder and harder to like them and their game as time goes on. Every new idea is met with disdain from the players as a whole because we know every new thing is a bug filled, overly grindy, and not fun experience. Everything feels really rushed, there's so little respect for their own player's time spent, and sometimes just plain lies thrown in our faces (Look up kuva lich and operation link trailers and compare that to what we got and STILL have, after months of those features being out). And perhaps the worst offense off all, is that they do specific and targeted nerfs on popular things, just because they are popular, in a cooperative game. This is an example that they have done a couple of times, if they release a new event where one of their warframes outshine other options because of how their kit works, they will then nerf that warframe after they themselves set up the event where that warframe will do well. They removed 8 player raids from their game because people could make strategies and team comps to make the hard activity easier, let that sink in, cause that speaks volumes about how they handle things. To give a specific example of how they work, they just released a new feature where you can pull a single pre determined (by them) ability from a warframe to put it on any other warframe. Before it went live, WITHOUT testing anything, they nerfed what they thought would be the 6 most popular abilities, instead of choosing a different ability to take, or making all the abilities taken a good one (cause most are just plain bad, where even the warframe it's on doesn't use the ability) they just made the best choices worse. I want to like Warframe, I really do, but when the game itself doesn't respect you and seemingly wants you to hate it, I can't do anything besides recommending playing a different game."

It really is something else sometimes but I have enjoyed my experiences and find myself coming back despite occasional extremely grindy content. I would probably chalk this down to being able to figure out how to play the game \"properly\" as mentioned before. It's obviously not something for everybody, but once you optimize your grinding strategies the game becomes far more enjoyable. I think most people just want to play the game for it's combat and don't care about getting everything, so it can be quite frustrating having to deal with annoying long term grinds and waiting for weapons/frames to finish crafting. Especially stuff like grinding for Khora or Ash."

            "Comment": "But what about the game itself? Well, in general Iâm not a huge fan of the F2P model (there are one or two notable exceptions). Usually the developers struggle to make it work. But Warframe is probably as good an example of this type of game as youâre likely to find these days. In many respects DE have got it right. It is possible to play completely for free, although I would encourage players to buy some Platinum (I have) as DE deserves to make a buck or two for all their hard work. Playing for free can put you at a slight disadvantage, but only when playing with players whoâve bought higher level weapons and frames. Success lies more in the mods you have available, and how you use them, than in anything else. Personally, Iâve only used my Platinum to buy additional inventory slots, as a large part of Warframe is the farming for, and building of new gear. And hereâs where the grind comes in. It goes on and on and on, and, as Iâve said, it can be both tedious and frustrating. Warframe is also the most complicated game Iâve ever played, mainly, I suspect due to its having been developed and modified over such a long period. Be prepared to spend a lot of time trying to fathom out what the hell youâre supposed to do. And then thereâs the gameplay itself: this is where Warframe scores most highly. The movement and combat mechanics are excellent. Every weapon (and there are so many of them) has a unique feel. Lots of them are just levelling up fodder but theyâre all fun to use. The same applies to the frames, of which there are approximately 60 (at time of writing). Of course there are keepers in amongst the chaff and these weapons and frames bring the most enjoyment. The parkour-style movement is well implemented and very satisfying once you get the hang of it. The mission types are limited but the main story line does offer some relief from the routine and is deeper and more fleshed-out than the stories found in many AAA paid-for games. The community is good for the most part: a âgit gudâ attitude does exist to some extent but itâs not prevalent. All in all Warframe is an impressive achievement: Itâs a well-designed game with lots of content and it offers a good deal of enjoyment. Itâs just a shame that itâs marred by the dispiriting grind. Recommended with the above qualifications. I thank you!"

After you get past the initial steep learning curve, you will find a fun and fast looter shooter that is deep (it has some amazing quests that explore the lore) and has a lot to offer.  It's fast game play makes it easy to pick up for a few missions, or you can spend hours grinding away at all the different frames and weapons.  One thing I love about this game is that no matter what you do, you always end up with material that you can use to progress towards building new gear or upgrading existing gear.  Your grind and time is not wasted.  And if something is too grindy, the devs tend to listen to the community feedback and fix things to streamline gameplay.  Something you don't really see from a lot of developers of this type of game."

So if you love games where you can lose yourself for hours, experimenting with builds, exploring alien worlds to kill some enemies, and feeling cool, Warframe is perfect for that. Itâs one of those games that stays with us forever."

            "Comment": "Similar in some ways to the multiplayer experience seen in Mass Effect 3, Warframe wastes no time in telling stories particularly elaborate. The background narrative, in fact, will give us an excuse to put ourselves in the shoes of ninja called to fight a futuristic alien faction. Home menu you can choose between different worlds to visit where we await missions to complete possibly in the company of three other players. Challenge between intergalactic ninja! The objectives vary enough, but the main flaw of the title Digital Extremes is out soon given the limited variety of levels. You will be prompted to save the hostages, locate a reactor to destroy or find an object, but whatever the delivery, in Warframe you'll almost always eliminate waves of enemies, chasing the various waypoint marked on the map. The gameplay, fortunately, fairly obvious problems of repetition of the title. With the view placed behind our Tenno (the name of the metal ninja who impersonate), we will have firearms and trusts katana. Come into play the Warframe champions representing the different possible configurations of the armor. These identify the different classes of ninja, with unique features useful to customize the game experience. Challenge between intergalactic ninja! Initially there are three, while the other can be purchased with real money or get through the crafting system included in the title. The Warframe not only change the appearance of your character, but activate specific skill such as enabling stealth attacks, rather than providing armor thicker than usual and so on. The user then accesses to further customizations to buy with credits earned in each mission completed successfully. These enhance the efficiency of its Warframe but not only. There are in fact many consumable items to carry around for the later missions, useful to address the weaknesses of its configuration and style of play."

Almost everything is obtainable through in-game means, and only a few cosmetic only items are for purchase of Platinum. There is an in-game trade hub where with some tips and tricks you can trade for the real in-game currencey called Platinum. If you are paitient, you can realistically get everything in the game. Save your beginner's Platinum for inventory slots! The Dev team is responsive, caring, careful, and the game is ever expanding. From how it looked two years ago to now is worlds apart, and it continues to grow!"

Solid game but needs a friend to help  u get into it"

Warframe offers hours of unique space ninja experience to players that no game has ever offered before in my humble opinion. Yet I can feel Destiny fans getting triggered, I must say that both early and late game experience in Warframe is amazing. You don't just have to hack and slash everything that comes in your vision. You can also fish, decorate, parkour, hunt and so on. Also the customization options to your characters (Warframes and *spoilers*) is infinite. Though the best thing about it is, you can do everything in game without spending a single dime on it. Yes you sometimes have to grind for it, but there is nothing in game that you cannot get via just playing it. Anyway would recommend it any day, hope If you try this game you like it as much as I did, though one small note, it can get quite addictive."

The speed and fluidity are next level, making it way more dynamic and exciting than Destiny 2. In Warframe, you're not just running from point A to point B; you're practically flying, flipping, and weaving through huge, varied maps. It adds so much energy to the gameplay, keeping every mission feeling fresh and fun. If you love a game that makes movement an art form, Warframe is in a league of its own."

This not the reason I am leaving this negative review though, because some guy traded fraudulent platinum (this game's premium currency) to me without my knowledge it was then removed from account which is understandable, but my account was suspended for having a negative platinum balance. They permanently suspended my account because I performed an in game trade with another individual and the only way to restore it is to give them money which makes no sense to me. It also would put my account at risk for a permanent ban because if someone trades fraudulent platinum to me again my account is permanently even if I didn't know the platinum is fraudulent."

            "Comment": "Honestly, the core game is good. It fits the space ninja theme and the combat is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ amazing. Theres also some of the most insane character customization in any game ever. The story of warframe is also a 10/10. But thats about it. The game is extremely grindy and repetitive and doesnt respect the players time at all. Theres a reason why 70% of players are new players. After a while the game becomes very stale, for a game thats supposed to keep you playing everyday for hours. After lets say 200 hours youll find yourself quitting the game and coming back every now and then to check for new things, which everytime will be a big disappointment, and wont keep you playing for more than 4 days, before quitting again and waiting."

Make sure that nothing is running in the background, and of course do not use chat at all if possible. People have received permanent bans for having historical figures as part of their username, so I also changed my name yet again just in case. I would recommend this as well, something simple & generic because who knows what someone will find offensive."

Grinding is relaxing for me and is rewarding, making it easy to acquire premium currency trough a well established tradingâ sistem. Clans and forums are really friendly with new players and youtubers make great and fun content for PvE and endurance runs. So if you want a relaxing community and a relaxing way to play an action shooter this is the best. Time consuming, fashion and helping others is the end game. Try it."

If you're new and you heard this game is very grindy, it's definitely the truth. BUT you'll love it anyway. There is a great story line to follow, well written, emotional, even more emotional thanks to some amazing music writing. There is PLENTY of other things for you to do aside from the story. From fishing on a lake or playing your string instrument to waging a war in the open space or commiting a ge**cide daily. You can play solo, or with a squad, or simply invite your bros. Massive amount of different weapons and a bunch of different characters to suit your playstyle. Plus, warframe community is one of the best communities I've ever seen! I hope this review gets somewhat of an attention to reach new players, and in the meantime I'm gonna go put a few more hundreds of hours into it. Time to wake up, Tenno!"

It contains an ever expanding arsenal of weapons, mods, and warframes that can be mixed and matched for endless possible combinations. The game also features a highly satisfying clan system including the ability to build your own clan hall, which provides several bonuses besides the simple meeting area with cosmetics. And the great feature of Warframe is that it always contains a challenge. From raiding the Orokin towers, to hunting down the elusive Stalker and Harvester, something is there to put your mettle to the test. And in case it wasn't clear, you play as freakin' Space Ninjas. What's not to love?"

For all the crap that the devs can get sometimes, they are always adding new content and adjusting old content to help make sure almost nothing is out of the meta. Sure it can be grindy at times but overall Warframe is just a great game to play. If you're just starting then get some friends to play with you to make it an even better experience!"

After all that prejudgement my friends kept recommending the game. I started one last time after first 6  quests I started to enjoy and understand the mentality  of the game. I noticed that the fun part is not the level design or the game modes. What makes game different is each warframes abilities and types of weapons  and melees you can use. There bunch of combinations with every weapon, mod and warframe. Each one gives you different play styles and that keeps the game fresh and fun. Game doesnt teach you everything but community is really good and helpful.Any stranger from chat or in forums will help you.Also there is trading in exchange of plat(microtransaction).That means if you grind enough you can trade your items to but this currency.I bought plat for ones with %75 discount it was worth supporting developers.After each update they always kept bringing new content and story missions.Every new patch and quest means more story and more to do.You should give it a try but be sure you played \"The Second Dream\" and \"War Within\" those are the major and damn cool quests every gamer should experience these two quest."

The game rewards trying out different frames and weapons so you don't have mains during the whole game. Did I mention this games is free? There is an currency called platinum but it can be easily obtained. Just play the game, get some drops and sell some to get plat. This time, acually spend more time having fun and playing the game than playing the market like Path of Exile. The gameplay is also incredibly fast-paced. Don't do conclave though, because cancerous PvP (actually cancerous, I think it's a meme in the community at this point). The devs are also super active, really listening to the community and updating their game with a bunch of new features, like archwings, new storylines and quest, glinding, frame fighters etc. And they do this without crippling their playerbase with sh*t dlcs (take f*cking notes bungie ^^)."

If you're thinking about buying the new prime access or the latest supporter pack, I would also say its worth it.  However, I've spent thousands of hours, and dollars on this game and I cannot justify spending any more money.  Game breaking bugs have remained in the game for years.  With every new update I wonder which new bugs I'll have to play around.  I've heard: \"this game is free, don't complain\" a lot.  Well, it's also not free, and I'd expect better from any other game or developer."

This game is a 3rd person co-op shooter game featuring (the generic definition) \"â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ space ninjas with magic.\" There is a large variation of characters to fit anyones play style including various and very unique and powerful energy abilities and weapons.  I have never seen a game with such advanced player movements including wall runs, sliding, jump kicks, and dodge rolling which really keeps the game feeling fast paced and exhilarating. The game excels in graphics, level design, and combat keeping the game very dynamic with the best experience making this one of the best free-to-play game in existence."

            "Comment": "While it's a VERY good MMO, and I have to enphasize this, it's excellently made, very detailed, the graphics are awesome, the theme is rather unique, it's also an EXTREMELY complicated game that can bog you down very quickly and very easily. It has practically zero tutorials, you're just flung in the deep end and told to swim, and that's the easiest of complications. Being this detailed and unique leaves the player with no actual frame of reference, even if you're a gamer and an MMO player. You need to \"translate\" all the otherworldiness into normal MMO terminology \"oh, this is the raids, this is the skill training, this is for pets\", so in order to find out what you need to do and how you either need someone else who knows the game to explain things to you or to spend many hours reading the wiki. Also it has thousands of different \"currencies\", all for different things, to buy things, to upgrade things, to modify things, to buy premium things, to do whatever, and it seems that everything has its own currency and you need to navigate through that too. You can extremely easily screw up, and get left without knowing what's next. If you're not ready to put that kind of commitment into it, I suggest you skip it, and herein lies the game's main problem: you have to really love it to play it, but you need to have played it to love it. So, it's no wonder it's rather dead on overall. Personally I found the gatekeeping everything behind \"mastery ranks\" very tedious, on top of all the rest of the complications."

Itâs definitely one of those games that keeps you coming back for more."

It has outstanding graphics, even on the lowest setting. However, this game in some aspects has a \"pay to win\" feel to it. To be able to get new items and characters in which they call \"Warframes\", you can either buy them with real life money, or invest immense amounts of hours into the game to get them, which isn't that bad at all because the game is really fun. The gameplay is terrific, and the given ability to free roam each individual map is superlative. Each map has different objectives, environments, and climates, whether its to the inside of an enemy ship, a snowy mountain, or some abnormal planet. If you're looking for a new game to play, that's free and not to mention fun, then Warframe is most definitely the game for you! If you heard any previous bad reviews about this game, just remember, it has improved a lot since its release date back in March."

We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this"

However in spite of all that its still one of if not the best free to play game available with a unique setting and story (what little there is) and amazing if slightly dated art design and graphics. In what other F2P can you trade the premium currency with other players, or get the premium items without spending it? yeah its a grindy game full of RNG and spending too long on simple things, but its still the best one of its kind."

You also need a good clan to start with otherwise It's on your own and you will stay clueless for awhile, once you start understanding I think It's worth playing and investing your time in!"

I might have to get my life in order but definitely an 11/10 game, make sure to use your starting plat for weapon slots only, find a clan for blueprints, take your time in the beginning and make sure to have fun!

If you enjoy doing literaly the same thing 239476 times in a row to have a chance at getting piece of something that might give you a possible not likely chance at a piece of a component to get a piece of gear, then play this game! If you enjoy grinding out the best gear in the game so that you can wait a few months for the next best gear to come out and then having no other use for that gear, then play this game! If you enjoy the crappy crafting systems of facebook games that take 3 days to craft one thing, then play this game! If you enjoy co-op games that involve one player doing literally everything while you struggle to even use that gear that you grided so hard for, have no fear, for this game is for you! PVE is repatative starting at your second mission, PVP is unballanced and boring, and crafting takes forever and has nothing innovative about it. Completing quest takes forever because most of the time, your progress is halted until something crafts over 24 hours. Low level, you are endlessly grinding. High level you have nothing to do except grind for a few days, then wait months for something new to happen to the game. If any of these features appeal to you, then play Warframe! Oh yeah, there is pokemon snaps and space dog tamagotchi built in, too."

For those who are ok with that, enjoy. For me, the bugs, the empty promises, the lack of continuity between events and the constant changes made to the lore have made me finally give up on it. I've finally given up hope the game can ever be, what Steve and Scott promised 6 years ago on that couch during their first devstreams. It has become hollow and bleak, it's universe barren, and at best, confusing."

Many people would sacrifice their first born for DE despite constant delays, setbacks, let downs, etc...  Many of the same players who complain on the official forums or Reddit will also turn around and tell you \"it will get better!\" when all evidence points to things continuing to degrade.  The official forums and Reddit are also moderated by an army of Brownshirts who ensure any dissension is quickly silenced."

However, Clan and Warframe community can provide you a team to make many mission types less frustrating. Some weapons and game features are locked in clan dojo, so to get some weapons and frames requires you to be part of a clan with access to clan dojo researches."

If you have a job in a real life and don't have a lot time, don't even try this game, 'cause they made it such way that they require from you to play with non-stop playing, grinding, grinding, grinding, never ending grinding with non stop. Another bad thing is, it got horrible community (forum) with lots of diehard fanboys who can't stand critics and devs who don't listen or read. Was reporting bugs several times, even messaged devs about them, but not even a single reply, oh by the way, speaking about bugs, there are lots of bugs in game. Another very frustrating thing in this game is, that to rank up, you must pass the test where u have 3 tries and if u fail, u must wait 1 day and try next day. They made practice rooms, but it's also aggravating, after failing, you are sent back to relay start and you need to walk again to enter in room. Oh did I mention that you don't run fast there & that room is far away and on second floor? Well, yeah, you can't run. In short, it's a \"Frustrateframe\". Just stay away from it."

I have a lot of time invested in some of these weapons, and one gun that got nerfed so that it really isn't usable in content I was using it for, and I have 4 of that weapon with just different greater focus lenses (sorry if this doesn't mean much to people who don't play the game).  There are probably some newer players who actually pay real money for warframes and guns, and anyone impacted by stealth nerfs to anything they paid real money for might be quite angry.  I have certain guns that I use not because of how they perform, but how they feel, and guns that are my go to guns just for feel are being nerfed for no good reason.  They don't have a big AOE and are \"ok\" at steel path, but not great.  Anyway, I'm not sure if I feel the way equipment will work in the future in this game is stable enough for me to invest time or money into anymore.  Even the nightwave reward track was a step away from the game being fun.  If there's FoMO, the game isn't for fun, IMHO."

This game has outstanding graphics and the optimization is solid. The gameplay and the in-game movement and parkour is a really fun addition to the game and really makes the game fast paced (at most times; the game still does have its dull moments). For a free to play game, youre getting so much gameplay and you can really pour some serious time into this game (currently at 1,804 hours atm). The game isnt without its flaws though. There are a few bugs that irritate the heck out of me such as mission waypoints bugging out and not displaying properly or the rare moments of falling through the map when deploying my K-Drive. Even with all the bugs though, I always find myself coming back to this game. The customization is also really something else. You have so many different options for skins, armor pieces and colors that you really can make your warframes stand out even amongst the same frames. The modding system (upgrade system) is also really extensive. If you really like a frame, you can mod it to the way you want to play so you can really excel at what you do. You can pretty much tune your frame to the way you want to play so theres so much freedom with making your builds. There's so much more I could say about this game but all im going to say is its definitely worth the time (and money) ive put into it. If youre on the fence on whether you should get it, give it a chance. Theres very little tutorial but if you find a helpful higher MR player thats willing to show you the ropes, give it some time. You will get it. You will want to join a clan early on for the extra tech that you get from being in one. Well, thats all i have to say for now. Good luck Tenno!"

My issue is that they keep adding new content, but not fixing any massive issues that should be simple to fix. for reference the Zariman tileset has MULTIPLE bugs that cause you to have to abandon the missions. Between enemies not spawning on exterminate missions, to exolizer not spawning on void cascade, and many others. These bugs have been getting reported for over 2 YEARS! If they were better at fixing these glaring yet simple to fix bugs then I wouldn't have any issue giving a mile long positive review, but for now I just can't over look these issues."

Then they mixed in a rogue lite element into it granting the player random bonuses after each mission, all while throwing you the player between the open world missions and the underside Warframe mode mission. It's just a mess. This was supposed to be targeted at new players which I just don't think makes any sense at all. You want new Players to master your brand new Elden Ring style combat then on the side learn about Warframes advance movement and gun play? I don't know what's going on with DE."

I didn't know this and acknowledged a players name being exactly that Nezhaisatrap I laughed but I said Nezha is a trap is a funny name I actually thought nezha was a girl this whole time. The player then reported me and boom perma banned till 2035. I've never heard of something so idiotic. Developers perma ban over an acknowledgement of a users name and misunderstanding of gender of one of there playable characters. 650 hours wasted.. Dont play this disaster of a game"

We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist.

There is enough of a learning curve as you progress and acquire higher damage weapons which are available only upon reaching the matching levels of ranking so you dont become bored with lower level missions. Definitely an amazing game which is Free to Play."

If you ever watch one of their dev streams, they don't ever face any criticism, don't address many bugs, etc, and instead only focus on random â¥â¥â¥â¥ that nobody except the 4 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ (which happen to also be in-game moderators) that suck up to them care about. The only thing that I can say has stayed consistently excellent in updates is the art direction, as everything with the exception of the player cosmetics/fashionframe stay true to the art style and are honestly pretty beautiful. Other than that though, all I can do is pray that DE gets their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together."

No need to pay to win as everything here is pure skill and gained through experience. The game layout is simple to understand and the map is huge, with two open worlds to explore, both of which include a way to create and name your own weapons and modify them to your guns and melees to you own ideals. I honestly can not say a bad thing about this game, i first played on ps4 in early 2018 and fell in love with it straight away. the ranking system is easy to understand but is irrelevant as the game allows you opportunities to mod your weapons and warframe to play on higher levels for longer, not to mention a recruit channel to allow you to play in a squad of 4, which will most likely be a range of players with different abilities, weapons, mods, and skill sets to help aid you in your missions !! People mention the farming being an issue but it is a much better alternative to paying for something with real money. If you've read this far already, then just download the game already !! NINJAS PLAY FREE !!"

As for the paying part of the game they have a good slection of prices and you really dont need to buy any unless you want stuff fast and dont feel like farming or want cosmetic addons for your gear and Tenno.I would recommend saving your Plat or buy Plat just for Tenno Spots(20 Plat) and Weapon Inventory slots(12 Plat 2 slots) ;) But if you are like me and dont mind spending on a few Plat to help suppport a real good F2P by all means spend away !! :) Plat price packages range from $4.99 (74 plat) to $199.99 (4300 plat + Rare Card mods).I give this game as a F2P a wopping 9/10 only reason i gave it a one point deduction is i think the prices in the store could be a tad cheaper.But all in all a darn good game so give it a shot if you are looking for a solid action game!!! See you on the Battle Field TENNO!!!!"

The Developers really do take a lot of input from the fans, the world they've built has no equal and the customization is absolutely insane. Not to mention that the gameplay itself, with free-running movement, slicing, smacking, whipping and stabbing with everything melee and all the projectile and laser weapons you can imagine. Activity always builds up more around the (very often and awesome) events, but it hahs enough content to keep you busy for months. I've been playing since March 2013, and I'm not considering uninstalling it in the near or far future. 10/10"

In the beginning of it's life (quite a few years ago) it was an ok game but over the years the dev's have done a very good job listening to the community and giving us most of what we thought should be incorporated in the game.  There is tons to do almost to a fault as it can be daunting starting out as a new player.  The whole drinking from a fire hose is a real thing in warframe.  And it is a little grindy but for a looter shooter that is 7 years or so old it really is still very fun.  It's easy to forget alot of the grind because the mission and level development is done pretty well.  All in all its a lot of fun and I recommend it to anyone who wants to be a space ninja.  Oh and it's also free.  And while that free does limit you to frames in the beginning, anything and everything (except event specific items and cosmetics) is obtainable by the player free of charge...especially if you are ok with trading with other players to get the ingame currently, platinum.  Pick it up and install it if you haven't.  I don't think you'll regret it if you like ninjas, space, and/or Big Farking guns."

Just requires a bit of farming to get.  Only things that arent, are Warframe slots, weapon slots, and vanity stuff like scarfs and colours.  Third person 4 player co-op shooter/hack and slash.  But of course if you are too lazy to farm stuff up... you can always pay money for new frames and weapons too."

The power you wield makes you feel like youâre actually a badass space ninja, because youâre killing lots of enemies quickly and efficiently. Other sci-fi games, like Mass Effect 2, force you into cover through a lack of health and a focus on small groups of enemies. Thereâs no sense of lethality or badassery going on when your character feels like theyâre made of soggy toilet paper while enemies can last through an entire magazine of gunfire. Warframe understands this, so every frame feels fun to play, because every frame has powerful, over-the-top capabilities."

It will be even worse for new players because all of the fun things I used along the way to max rank have been trashed by the devs because too many people liked them.  ISN'T THAT THE POINT!!!  The development team is so focused on stopping people from enjoying the good parts of the game that they have made everything bad out of spite."

Itâs a game that never stops growing from a developer who is passionate about working with its community. It also just feels amazing to play, with a satisfying kill-collect-craft loop thatâs supported by a mountain of player choice and some wonderfully responsive movement mechanics. Some of its systems are needlessly complex and improperly explained, making it easy to get overwhelmed or burnt out, but thereâs just so much to do here that Warframe always excitingly pulls me back with its next update."

            "Comment": "Warframe is an incredibly rewarding and action-packed game that offers fast-paced, fluid combat and a deep progression system. With a strong focus on co-op gameplay, constant content updates, and extensive customization options, it provides an engaging experience for both new and veteran players. However, its grind-heavy progression system and steep learning curve may discourage some players. Despite these challenges, Warframe remains one of the best free-to-play games available, offering a wealth of content for those willing to dive into its complex systems. If youâre a fan of sci-fi shooters with cooperative gameplay, Warframe is definitely worth checking out."

We all agreed while it's great for a free to play game containing some beautiful graphical work, some interesting game mechanics, and good controller support, it gets tedious very quickly and nothing really makes it stand apart from a failed third-person action game like Too Human unfortunately. It's also quite a tough game to get a grip of as it contains lack of explaination about how certain aspects of upgrading and customising a character work. Regardless, I'd recommend giving it a bash, it's a good bit of fun at first but nothing I can see myself playing in the long term and spending money on! :)"

If those are not a problem, hop in and try it. You can get everything in the game for free without spending a single dime if you're patient. I've played it for over 3 years, in and out, and have almost everything just because I did not put in much effort to get some weapons / parts, but that is just a matter of dedicating time."

It's pretty fun initially, DE have worked their arses off to get it from the abysmal state it was in during its original release to its current surprisingly polished form and the hours tick by quickly. However, the more you progress the less fun it gets, with repetition, dumb AI and ridiculous grinding eating at your very being. Personally, I felt relieved when I uninstalled it and have committed to never playing a grindy game like that ever again, but if you can stomach that and you only care about kicking low IQ AI arses while zooming around like Sonic the Hedgehog, this game will keep you entertained for hundred of hours."

The grind is heavily RNG based, and with my luck, everything takes three times as long as for a regular player. And then combine that the grind isn't explained a bit, you're just left fumbling through wiki tabs just to figure out what to grind for. And I know. The grind is better than other looter shooters. The grind is better now in 2025 than in 2016. But a grind is still a grind. Who actually enjoys wasting hours trying to grind for relics and then grinding for void to upgrade those relics and then hoping you get the right blueprints and then starting over again because you have terrible luck and then the ingredients for those those blueprints when you finally get it and then finally crafting the warframe or weapon, only to have to wait 72 hours?"

You can absolutely play the game without spending a dime, though if you play for a long time you'll eventually want to spend a couple bucks on slots so you can keep trying new weapons and frames without trashing your old ones. If you're just looking for a skinner box and a cheap dopamine hit, there are worse games to spend your bandwidth on. But there are also many, many better ones."

The problem is, I am convinced DE has made the good parts of Warframe entirely by accident. I would say 95% of their decisions are mind blowingly stupid or just anti-consumer. No matter how much feedback they get from players, no matter how many partners they have to listen to, the insanity just continues. The problems are found everywhere, from the atrocious new player experience, to the pitiful \"end game\". So many systems are overly complicated for no reason. The lack of explanation and proper information is unacceptable. You CANNOT play this game just by loading it up and starting, multiple outside sources of info are required to even get started. So many systems are horrendously outdated and pointless. Most of the content is fragmented on separate islands. This game lacks direction and leadership like I have never seen. I played about 1000 hours on here, had some good times tbf, then got to the end game and ran out of reasons to keep farming. And that's when I began to realize that even though the game has a reputation for being \"F2P done right\" and \"the devs who are fair and care about the community\" it's all BS. So I can't do it anymore. It is a shame."

It has been one of (if not THE) my best F2P experiences, with intense action, a wide variety of characters, weapons, abilities and customization (still expanding often even) you hardly ever get bored. Plenty of clan-housing with many different options, once again with loads of customization, seriously, the amount of customization in this game is friggin' nuts! The only bad thing is if you feel its becoming a grind, so play it with people you think you'd enjoy it with to increase the life of the game for you. I'd probably give it a 8/10."

Throw in a few more types of battle formats.. (like arena fights for instance) maybe a little vehicle warfare... (space ninjas on hoverbikes would be the bee's knees).. the current maps that are playable in the game make for good \"instances\" but a more open world approach would help bring more gamers to the scene without question."

I've put the time in and i can tell you it has been quite the ride. I may sound critical but it's because of my love and expectations of this game these lofty critiques developed. tbh it's in the top 5 best game's i've ever played. Hell, i may even come back one day, but the endless grind, continual content droughts and thoughtless insults to veteran players are a spin cycle than has left me apathetic and disinterested."

It's overwhelming for new players, and much of the game relies on grinding, which means doing the same activities over and over again. However, what you get in return is an extremely satisfying movement system/gameplay, a massive arsenal of weapons and classes, a super deep modding system, a massive amount of content to experience with items in each activity to incentivize playing them, as well as one of the most helpful and friendly communities in gaming. Warframe is bold in it's design, and the developers are never shy to take risks, changing massive parts of the game. If you really take the time to learn the basic systems of the game and push through past the intro planets, you'll be greatly rewarded. Highly recommend this title especially since it is 100% FREE."

I recommend the game to anyone and everyone, it's free, not pay to win but optional to smooth your grind out if you don't wanna grind that much and all items can be gained in the game except Tennogen content, those are made by workshop creators and the money earned from them are earned.

            "Comment": "You play as a Tenno, a person psychically linked to one of several bio-mechanical surrogate bodies known as Warframes. These enhanced bodies are capable of incredibly acrobatic feats and superhuman strength. So, in essence, you control a sci-fi ninja who hacks, slashes, and shoots the many looming threats that encroach upon the galaxy. The reward is the loot used to improve your arsenal, improve your Warframes, and of course, improve your look,Warframe is a mission-based game, for the most part, that tasks you with visiting various planets to defeat genetically modified humanoid warmongers, giant robots, and other threats that present themselves as you make headway through the story. The missions include target assassinations, escorting or saving NPCs, collecting a key item, or fighting a major boss character. In nearly each mission, your Warframe slices, dices, and blasts any grunts that get between you and your target. There is a modicum of strategy to the carnage, though. Levels have a fantastic degree of verticality thanks, and even enclosed environments incorporate multi-level architecture and alternative paths, giving you a choice as to whether you want to rush in guns blazing or sneak through stages to avoid alarms and rack up stealth kills,Warframe's combat doesn't resemble Devil May Cry or Ninja Gaiden's juggle-based action, but there's so much gameplay flourish that it could easily be lumped together with said titles. In many respects, the action carries a Platinum Games flair. As in Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, Warframe gives you a basic melee combo string, an auto-deflect tactic against ballistics that activates while running, and a shocking degree of mobility and speed. Warframes can seamlessly slide, dash, wall-jump, and double-jump, and they can go straight into an attack or shot at any point during these actions. It feels good."

Longest farming run I've had was only a few days with my truly fun casual clan. There are pretty much 0 paywalls in the entire game aside from frame and weapon slots which are extremely cheap! (This free to play has to make money somehow). The nearly weekly updates also shows the dev team's determination to keep the game fresh and their dedication to the game and its community."

Digital Extremes really did this game right, give it a try and you won't be disappointed."

They have made it clear that they do not accept the followers of the Jewish religion nor their values. I submitted a clan emblem portraying the Star of David, as it has been used for centuries to portray the long-oppressed Jewish people, but it was quickly denied by Digital Extremes. The Jews have been silenced similar to this since the dawn of Christianity and have had to go through horrors that can barely be imagined such as the Holocaust. As a Jew, I play video games to escape this constant persecution and pressure placed onto me by even modern society, but even here, in my lone place of solitude, I am forced to hide my religious beliefs. This sort of behavior is unacceptable for a company (or for anyone, for that matter!) and I truly hope that you do not give them a dime. Supporting these monsters is ultimately supporting the destruction of Jews."

For me it was the breaking point of a downwards trend of buggy, grindy, unfinished feeling updates that left me feeling incredibly burnt out on the game. After returning for 1999, I'm incredibly happy to say that DE knocked it out of the park. I was skeptical at first due to a bit of a hatred for time travel plots, but they really make the most out of what they have and go above in beyond in the gameplay and story here, and especially the music. This is honestly easily the best update for me since Plains of Eidolon or The Sacrifice and I'm very happy to enjoy this game again."

You can go from being a space ninja zooming around the map to a humble fisherman. Game is completely free as is all new content added the old stuff usually sits there gathering dust for experienced players but for new players is usually worth going through to get the rewards."

Digital Extremes has put tons of effort and hours into the game to make it enjoyable and playable, even with the minor bugs that pop up every so often. A solid game with some story to it; however, if you just want to have a game where you can be a \"space ninja\" that guns down, slices, and murders everything then look no further. Whether you enjoy solo play or team play, Warframe is a game that fits all needs. Even though there is an optional in game payments, it is not necessarily a pay to win. All items, warframes, weapons, and companions are farmable in the game. The use of actual money isn't to make you overpowerd, it is more or less a way for you to get whatever it is you want without the farming (did I forget to mention that there is a lot of grinding in this game for stuff? HUh.... only downside)."

It wants you to consistently log back in to spend money and time. I would rather spend my time on other games that respects my time and money more then this game. If you want to play it go ahead, its still a solid game but if your time spent ends up amounting to anything will rely purely on what you are trying to get out of this game."

Looking at you, Kinda strange how the pendulum swings for gaming today. We can already name certain AAA companies that try this model and just don't follow up on doing it right. But for DE, they got it right. That's a big plus in my opinion. They just keep on adding more stuff to the game. Hope to see those space battles soon."

Yes, there is a PvP game mode, but rarely are people logged in there, plus, you don't get to use all your abilities and items obtained from grinding in there. You play with a skeleton warframe. Defeats the purpose of getting abilities and items in the first place. There should be more of a storyline too. One of the perks is that the community is friendly and players are always willing to help one another progress through the game."

As such, I will have to make this a negative review, no matter what I think of the game itself."

You will end up having a horrible time and if you get too involved in the game, it will be hard to stop playing for good. You will always come back and have a bad time again. It's going downhill in terms of balance, community health and even security. Until these issues are properly addressed and proper steps are taken, I can't recommend this game to anyone. And sadly, with how long it's been going, I don't see them being addressed in neither near nor far future."

Its a horrible game but its as addictive as crack cocaine. Its like that ex that treats you badly but you go back and hope they've changed. They haven't. They're somehow worse, but you forgive them every time because you don't love yourself enough to know when to quit. 1/10 game, would recommend"

I woke up today trying to log onto dead by daylight but the site was down, I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. I couldnât go to school today, I am nothing without dead by daylight, it is my life, it is my destiny, without dead by daylight, I wouldn't be able to do anything. dead by daylight is the best thing ever made and I can't get rid of my addiction to it, it is the best game in existence. I can't stop trembling and crying, I am very worried. I used all of my money on dead by daylight, I bought goth mommy sable ward. I will make sure to prestige every single character to the max. especially sable ward. I don't know what to do. dead by daylight can't be gone any longer cause if it does then I'll go insane again.. breaking my mouse, chair, house, and everything I own. dead by daylight is very amazing and I can't lose it."

            "Comment": "Dead by Daylight is not a game. It is a cosmic punishment sent by indifferent gods to remind humanity of its insignificance. Booting it up is like willingly inserting your face into a malfunctioning wood chipper. Nothing makes sense. Hitboxes defy physics. Perks do not function unless you chant in Latin. Killers phase through walls like demonic glitches. Survivors collapse into puddles of incompetence the moment a heartbeat sounds. Every match is a dissertation in disappointment, a Shakespearean tragedy written by drunken raccoons on fire. You don't play Dead by Daylight you endure it, like a prisoner endures solitary confinement, counting the cracks in the wall until madness becomes your only friend. Updates break more than they fix, a perpetual motion machine of failure. Pallets fly away into the sky. Generators burst into flames because a moth sneezed on them. Flashlights either stun the killer or open a black hole on the map, no in between. Queue times feel longer than the lifespan of stars. And the reward for surviving? More blood points so you can suffer again. Again. And again. This game has personally lowered my IQ. My dreams are skill checks now. My hands tremble when I hear the Entityâs noise. If Dante had known about Dead by Daylight, there would have been a Tenth Circle of Hell and THIS would be the only thing playing. I would rather be force-fed glass by a rabid moose than ever install this corrupt, festering, soul-devouring, sadness-engine ever again. Dead by Daylight isnât a horror game. Itâs a warning. A cursed artifact. It is a SCREAM into the VOID and the VOID screams back."

My grandson recently downloaded Dead by Daylight and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my grandson, as he is always out with his friends and I was busy having parish zoom call meetings. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Grandson for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my grandson since I'm no longer chairman of the parish council. This game has ever since brought my grandson and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my grandson many happy memories."

But in this case, because they are completely whimsical in their processes and negligent in their customer care, giving them real, hard earned money is a gamble.

Then u play survivor to chill a bit and u have killers that camp and tunnel but tbh im not blaming them after i saw how survivor sided this game become so killers have to play scummy to get ONE kill. not gonna mention the cheaters. Literally NO fun anymore in this game and i cant believe others dont see that a lot have to change for this game to be fun again."

This game has its claws rooted deep in me, and I can not take more than a month-long break before I'm right back to it. If you are down for a potential beat down on your psyche until the moment you have enough experience to have a good time, or you want to get up in a game with the homies, this is an addicting game that, although it is a slog, will keep you coming back for more."

BHVR have outright banned people based on nothing but a Streamer's suspicion that there was foul play. If you lag in game against a streamer, and they report it, you're gone, no proof or investigation. The development team favour streamers over everyone else and it is wrong. Ignoring that the game is fun, not hard to get into. Ignore the occasional toxic player and you'll be fine. Never be upset you don't escape or don't kill everyone, at the end of the day all you get out of it is bloodpoints."

New Survivors, Killers and Maps keeps getting added here and there. The only problem that i think of, can be that there is many toxic/rude people out there that likes to try and harm you if ur having a bad game. No one is perfect. No one can have perfect game every game. Everyone has bad games that comes here and there. People can complain about you playing bad if you're doing 1 little mistake. You play the way you like to play. Don't let other people harm you for the way you're playing. But otherwise i think Dead by Daylight is a great game that keeps people to come back and play this game."

I bought the game just over a year ago and have already racked up over 1,100 hours because itâs so damn addictive to play. The constant improvements and love that the devs give to this game and the community has made it last unlike certain other games *cough* Friday the 13th *cough*, not to mention the new content that comes out every couple of months, introducing badass new killers and survivors, and a beautiful new map. Yes the community is toxic as hell and triggers the s*** out of me from time to time, and itâs not the most balanced of games, but it doesnât stop me from loading it up on a daily basis to have fun."

A strange man appears from the shadows wearing a mask and hits me with something sharp. I yell out in pain and run for my life. I vault windows and drop pallets on my relentless pursuer. But despite my best efforts I end up cornered. I can hear fast approaching footsteps, they almost sound excited with anticipation. With nowhere left to go I jump into a locker. The man passes me by and I think I'm safe, but then manic eyes gaze into my own through a slit in the locker. I try to move, I try to scream, but it all happens in slow motion, and the next thing I know I'm being carried and thrown on a hook. I scream until someone rescues me and I run with them. But then the manic sadist reappears and I get separated from my rescuer. The pursuer follows me, getting closer as I run out of breathe, almost exhausted. I hear the sound of metal hitting concrete as I throw the last of my strength into vaulting a window. I gaze behind me, thinking my pursuer will surely follow, but the sadist just watches me as I stagger between two tall posts and escape into the night."

            "Comment": "This game has truly been a very memorable journey, there is definitely a good, a bad, and an ugly to this game. I personally feel Dead by Daylight is a must play for horror fans or people who just want a good scare every now and then or be the people who want to scare others!. Dead by Daylight is without a doubt not a perfect game as most aren't, but I believe every penny I spent on this game was well worth it. I wouldn't even mind paying full price. Within Dead by Daylight you'll come across so many different types of people while playing; people who care for each other even if they are just strangers just trying to accomplish the same goal survive, people who are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that will make you feel like an idiot for almost no reason, people that are poor sports ETC disconnecting from the game if something doesn't go their way or feel something that the killer did was not fair (which sometimes can be understood if you too see it as a good reason). People who you can relate with, have a good laugh and even become lifelong best friends, you will also come across people who you wonder are even on the same planet as you in terms of how they appear on profile/act in game. If you plan on buying this I'd suggest making sure that you are a good sport; don't just follow one survivor at a time until they die (tunneling), don't drop pallets onto other survivors that didn't do anything wrong (exception for playing with friends wanting to see them die and if they agree to trying to fight you off during the match along with the killer trying to kill your team), don't call people meaningless stupid names after the match is done its just unnecessary negative energy that nobody deserves/needs. I feel this game might help you understand a little bit more about yourself in terms of what kind of perks you like to use, how you work with others, how you kill survivors, what killers you like, what survivors you like. You might even discover if you really do have anger issues or are a poor sport after all Â¯\\_(ã)_/Â¯. This game has A LOT of replayability in my opinion with months and months of grinding blood points to put into your favorite killers/survivors to unlock new perks even leveling them to prestige three having a full bloody outfit for them for every character in the game killer/survivor, collecting iridescent shards to unlock new cosmetics for the characters you enjoy playing as. This game might even be seen as therapeutic to some people such as myself, some people say they cant start their day off right without coffee for me its I cant start my day off right without killing people or fighting off a bloodcrazed killer coming for me. If you deal with a lot of stress killing survivors or pallet slamming a killer might make you feel better or even saving a teammate in the heat of combat might make you feel better. You can most certainly make friends in this game and forge friendships after just hours of gameplay!. If you already have close friends that enjoy horror and video games I'd highly recommend you invite them to play with you as it could be a great bonding experience. If you like horror memes this game has TONS of high quality memes in stock just waiting for you to see. In Dead by Daylight you will lose some and win some that's just how it is on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of an Earth. This concludes my TEDtalk. Have a nice day â¤â¤â¤"

Which is sad, because I used to absolutely LOVE this game, its been all I've played this year. But just know if you buy it today, the majority of people playing survivor you will get on your team will likely just give up and die because they know they can't win. And if you play killer? Good luck, the first 10 hours of playing the same killer will be a cake walk, and then you'll never be able to have fun playing them ever again."

            "Comment": "The devs recently caused Nvidia filters to no longer function. I have severe eye issues (late stage keratoconus and various un-diagnosed issues). My various aforementioned ailments cause focusing on anything to be extremely difficult (my focused view is roughly the same quality as my peripheral vision without using steroid eye drops) and i have used Nvidia filters to increase the gamma and/or brightness and use auto depth of field so i can still play games. Up until now i have had to use a filter specifically to *drastically* increase brightness during dredge nightfall as well. Please note that this filter does not change the intended dark area much, without it i cannot see anywhere in the intended visible area. Without these filters i cannot physically play anywhere near the ability of abled players. They also decided to buff dredge this patch... I likely will not be able to consistently have playable survivor games for a few weeks (possibly months) depending on how long this stays. Please revert this change BHVR (or add some accessibility settings for people like me)."

If you are hanged 3 times thats it, you are out and in queue for the next game. On the other hand playing killer was a roller coaster. (hands sweating, constant stress to keep up the pressure and maintain control, being bullied by better players. etc) Still it is refreshing to play from time to time as long as you keep it casual."

I know it's an overused word used by the oversensitive, but there is a lot of \"toxic\" behavior in the game, and the complete lack of sensible matchmaking only exacerbates that issue. The game has been out for 4 years and still doesn't have proper matchmaking, and still struggles with what should be simple balance changes. It's honestly a miracle that the game didn't die out shortly after launch with how terrible the devs are. They truly stumbled and fumbled their way into success with DBD. Just be careful if you ever decide voice any thought in a non PG way on their forums, as their community moderators are so draconian as to make the schutzstaffel blush."

My son recently started Dead By Daylight and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\""

There are other issues with this game, like the ranking system being messed up and practically useless, but I feel what I've said is more than enough.

Try civilization or something.\" This was literally a developer saying that they aren't going to fix the obvious balance issues that there game has. I hope that in the future this game will be fixed and will once again be a magnificent and unique horror game, but for now please avoid it for your own sake."

The first time you take a piece of that sweet bubble gum, the flavor is incredible! and after some time, it starts to taste like crap. and yet you take another piece over and over. What I'm trying to say is. That this game starts of very fun, and the more you play it, the worse it gets. Yet after you rage about being tunneled by a 7 year old prestige 3 cannibal main, who is only allowed to play on the weekend at his dad's house, and is 10 ranks bellow you, you still play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, its basically a love and hate relationship."

As repetitive as it is, itâs just as addictive as drugs or sex. Dead by Daylight isnât a gameâitâs a spiral.

            "Comment": "In all the years I have spent playing video games, I have never been more upset and disappointed at a development team than I am at BHVR. I have put almost 3,000 hours into this game playing both killer and survivor because it's actually fun, unique, and addicting. You can play a range of killers that all have unique powers and have their place in the game, or you can play as a survivor with some bomb ass cosmetics. Not to mention the licensing from popular classic horror movies and video games. There is no other game out there that can compete with Dead by Daylight.  However, with each new patch that is released, it has become apparent that the devs do not care about their community. They add killers whose powers are unbalanced, perks that are broken and unfun for both sides, and matchmaking has been in a state of misery making solo q survivor unbearable and killer boringly easy. Each patch is met with new cosmetics and random changes that no one asked for rather than addressing bugs that are game breaking. On top of this, the feedback they receive on their changes are completely ignored. What is the point of releasing a PTB and gathering feedback if none of it matters, and they're going to release the changes anyway? No one wanted graphical updates. No one enjoyed being forced to kick breakable walls to break infinites that have been reintroduced to maps. No one enjoys being hit from 10m away because of desync. No one wanted a new HUD. No one wanted new movement. It hurts to see a development team willingly kill their game because they simply don't care what their community has to say about it when their community is what is keeping the game alive. I have put almost 3,000 hours into this game because I love it, and now I regret ever buying it. Save yourself the trouble, and do not buy this game until the devs show they actually deserve the money you are about to give them."

If you just want to mess around a bit and see what its like then go for it but essentially the Killers actively want to make you have as much of a toxic experience against them as possible and vice versa for the Survivors if you're playing killer."

This game requires a lot and I mean a LOT of patience to deal with toxicity. Who knows: you may get hooked (pun intended)."

Although all of them can be affected by perks, your baseline skill is what will win trials. Early on, certain healing/aura/exhaustion perks will help as you get used to the game. No matter what you end up with at the start, try adapting so you can learn to use all>any>no perks, itâs silly and lots of fun. Perks cause play style variety that adds flavour otherwise itâs like playing a time management sim whilst being chased down by a scary monster. ðð"

I have given BHVR the benefit of doubt many times before, but their sheer incompetence and stubborness to make good changes is mindblowing. This is not a game I would ever recommend to anyone - you would be much better off playing any other MP games with friends, odds are they might have devs who are way more competent and actually test their damn patches and balance things at a reasonable pace instead of once in a blue moon."

The current state of the game is the worst it has ever been. \"Camping\" and \"Tunneling\" are two terms that everyone in the community should be very familiar with and it is also overwhelmingly present in matches lately. I read a comment once about this game and it still rings true to this day. \"The game is designed in a way that if one side is having fun, then the other side is not.\" The developers at Behavior are some of the worst devs I have ever seen for a video game. Almost 8 years and their game only gets worse over time. Instead of fixing broken mechanics, they would rather release new skins and new characters. The devs are completely out of touch with the player base and rarely listen to complaints that need to be looked into. This game is no longer worth my time or your time until the current state gets some needed attention. Do not waste your money or your time. There are better games with better communities and better devs. THIS GAME SUCKS! Plain and simple."

Fail the chase get downed, watch your teammates not saving and start t-bagging you. Get toxicated by killers nodding and injecting false hope of survival and teammates not helping you and instead helping the killer to find and kill you.

No matter how many hours you see people clock into this one, I promise that your time and money are better spent elsewhere. This is one of the few games Iâve played that punishes you for being good and rewards you for being bad. Since the devs like to prioritize skins and licensed killers over a working game, Iâd like to recommend the new killer they release to be themselves. Dead by daylight is dying, and with every new character they release they kill the game more."

There is no perfect answer for everyone. Sometimes you'll get into a lobby very quickly that has subpar balance, and other time's you'll queue for half an hour before reaching your first lobby. I expect the new ranking system will change things up as time goes on and adjustments are made."

My son recently downloaded Dead by Daylight and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

Leon, Jill, and the Nemesis are great additions to the game and I hope to see more collaborations with different games. The game anniversary items are also a nice addition to the game. The sacrificial cakes (anniversary offering that gives 105% more bloodpoints) give a significant amount of bloodpoints (game currency to upgrade characters). This really helps with people who just got the game, like me and my friends. We are able to level up our characters really fast and progress in the game a lot easier. The game is super fun and I totally recommend this to people who are looking for a game to play with friends competitively, casually, or even both! I also think that the DLC is worth it (although get it when it goes on sale or your friend has it on library share)! All the characters are really fun to play! + All characters are needed to complete all achievements."

My only issue with this game is when the killer slugs every survivor and leaves everyone on the ground for no apparent reason.  At that point it just pushes me and new players away from the game.   Due to that fact, the game's community carries a very negative weight from me, but I'll still vote this as a positive review because the intense natural games outweight those that are ruined."

Definitely wait for a free weekend or when the base game goes on sale as well as it's DLCs whenever possible. I also highly recommend looking up basic guide on how to play both sides, the Tutorial is pretty good, if basic, but it's worth it to spend an extra 20 minutes looking up a video guide or even a written one, especially a Killer-specific guide if you plan on trying out a Killer from the game."

It is one of the worst multiplayer games to pick up and play due to the sheer amount of knowledge required just to get started, and the lack of a competent tutorial does NOT help. However, if one is willing to suffer for a few hundred hours to get to an average skill level, Dead by Daylight can be one of the most fun and in depth multiplayer games out there. The infinite techs and nuances surrounding each and every killer allow for thousands of hours of niche mechanical and strategic development that very few games can offer. After accruing nearly 2k hours across both Steam and Console, I often still find myself learning new things about the game, and even the killer that I specialize in, and have put hundreds of hours into mastering. Overall, Dead by Daylight is a great game for someone that is seeking a (VERY) challenging but rewarding experience."

The camping bar has basically added nothing to the game and defeats the entire purpose of helping camping. Taking longer and longer these days to get in matches. Most of the killer changes just is not for the better and honestly just made more of the killers unfun to play or play against. Game has progressed into more of a comp style game instead of a fun, new, horror game. The maps continue to get smaller every single update with some gens and hook spawns being no more than 15 meters away. At some point this game will lose players and eventually become lost in the void. Also to top it off the game is basically unplayable when it comes to other players now. Unless you are playing a SWF you can basically kiss 90% of the wins away because of either trolls, new players, no progress in gaming getting done, or teammates just letting you die on first hook or disconnecting from getting down once."

Instead of actually fixing it the developer continues to just push out content to rake in more money.  No real improvement to the existing content.  You can argue \"it's just a game\", that's true.  Games are supposed to be fun though.  This game is just stale and I doubt anything will be done to make it better."

The Devs are visible, they try to keep the community informed, and are always releasing new content, which is great, but I believe that more focus needs to be put into ensuring the core of the game is perfected first. If you're new, you're in for a rough ride, but it gets better, and much more enjoyable. There's alot of great aspects to the game, which makes it worth spending time in. You *will* get frustrated, you *will* have some absolutely horrible matches, but you \"Join a Lobby\" and take another stab at it. Overall, the good outweighs the bad in my opinion, and I trust the developers to keep chipping away at the monumental task that is balancing the game."

            "Comment": "This game is a bully simulator for adults and probably kids who got bullied in school, so they play survivor and at any chance of outplay will try and put you down. It's one of the most horribly balanced games I have ever played topped with the most toxic community of people to ever come together. I play dota 2 regularly and would only get a few hate comments on my profile from time to time. If you want to play DBD you have to make it so non friends can't comment or every entitled man child will leave as much graffiti on your profile as a school bathroom. This game at its core, at the top of \"meta\" perks and killers is incredibly un-fun and boring and the devs don't care because they balance the game around fresh installs to reel them in, in hopes of getting them to spend their lunch money on cosmetics only for them to find their hard work time and effort in learning the game has turned it into a stressful micromanaging rat race to see who cries in the end game chat first about something someone did trying to win. If this game didn't have a population of people with the mentality of teenagers who cry any time someone doesn't play by \"their rules\", that don't exist in the game, it would just be a hard grindy game where you get a worse experience the longer you play it. As killer at higher mmr you just don't get to play the game unless you camp and tunnel people out of the game or you are nurse or blight. As survivor you will only end up going against those two and both sides will run the same handful of perks out of the DOZENS of useless ones."

Game has gone on sale for $12; however, HumbleBundle has offered $9 this year (that lucky SOB of mine). To all my buddies n non-partisans, here are the perks u should seek out as a survivor: Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Ironwill, Self Care, Empathy, Premonition, Spine Chill, Leader, Urban Evasion, Technician, We'll Make it Together. This game still has glitches on the gameplay mechanics and lobby searches, but it's a major improvement from its preliminary stage. Also, I would be sorry (not sorry) 'bout the detailed review, but this game is intricate n I only scratched the surface (oh well). Cheers, my dawlings....try not to get hooked x]"

Before you think about a purchase, however, you should be aware of what kind of community this game has. There is no way to please people. The developers have done a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥ but they've been trying hard for some time now and there's only negative things coming from the community. \"Uhh the nerf from the Survivor Perks was â¥â¥â¥â¥\" \"Uhh I have to learn a new meta\" \"No, I don't play that anymore Killer/Survivor is way too OP right now\" Often this criticism is wrong, many people are not able Investigating problems or to verify that they exist. Often there is no constructive criticism wich makes it very difficult for the developers to connect to the community and understand problems. Of course this is not always the case, there are many people who are really trying to improve the game. Nevertheless, negative, groundless and annoying screaming is always there. I hope that if you decide to buy it, you won't let this negative review influence you too much, there are a lot of changes going on right now and you have to be open to something new after each and every patch, not everyone is able to do that. I hope that as a future player, even with the greatest anger, you can still have fun with this game, respect the developers and your fellow human beings and, despite everything, connect with this great burning garbage can of a community."

I would never recommend this game to anyone as it is in the worst state this game has ever been in. This game will disappoint you and waste your time and money. The community is toxic, the devs are clueless and must not play their own game, they just make fodder perks and skins leaving the dumpster fire they created behind to torment the fanbase. If they dont care about their game neither should you. If you do get this game then prepare for DC's, Tunneling, Camping, Unbalanced gameplay, Toxicity, Bugs, etc. None of that will be fixed by the dev team because they are money hungry fiends."

There are vases in the game where things seem OP r â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, but it is a game of startgey and doing what you can to win does kind of matter to some peope while others like me don't really care! Knowing that every single match will be different keeps me going after all this time. When I started the game was so imbalanced that it was unplayable.. This game SHOULD have died on relase, but with the dedicated team behind it it has survived so well to be much, much ore balanced. The first matches will send anyone's heart racing and that is EXCATLY the element of the game I love. Dont be overwhelemed with the amount of locked characters, in 100 hours you can already get 4-5 of them, and NONE of them are must buys. Many negative reviews you see are from people salty at the game that things are no longer OP, so pay no mind to \"The game is balanced!!111!!\" reviews. Bye! o/"

My final statement would be that it is genuinely a fun game for awhile. The learning experience is daunting, with the huge pool of perks and characters to learn not only how to use, but how to face as well, but It is also fun encountering and trying new things. However, the more you learn about the game, clearing the excitement of discovery and exploration the more you do, you will begin to see the repetitive nature of the game more and more clearly, and will begin to start begging for that same incentive that I have."

Flashlights and pallet saves are too easy and braindead, Nurse got nerfed into the ground, scratch marks are broken, the terror radius is doing the opposite of what it's supposed to do, you have to spend bloodpoints to participate in the event, and even if you do and burn an offering, the killer can disconnect and waste your offering or camp the lunar generator, and the survivors can sabotage the lunar hook or disconnect before being hooked. There's absolutely NOTHING good in this patch. They obviously didn't test their patch, because all it takes is 1 game to find out most of that. And you can bet they're gonna take at least a week to fix any of that as usual."

It is very easy to win as killers, but the toxic members of the community like to leave negative reviews because the devs have backbones and do not give them everything that they want. As an experienced killer, I kill everyone in almost every game I play, no matter if the survivors are friends or not. The game is worth it, but you need to be able to withstand the pressure from hateful people through comments."

They don't take responsibility for their own bugs and exploits, even going as far as to REVOKE OVER 800 HOURS WORTH OF PROGRESS as a 'punishment' for accidentally abusing a very small exploit that gave absolutely no advantage to any players in the actual gameplay itself. Instead of banning hackers and toxic players, BHVR spends their time making poor cosmetics and revoking progress from those unfortunate enough to stumble upon one of the game's many bugs and exploits. This game has turned into a complete and utter cash grab ever since the store came out pretty much exactly 1 year ago. I dont know if someone else was suddenly put in charge but this game has gone completely downhill."

            "Comment": "I have seen many different games fail because of the same reason: Developers not listening to their player base and being high and mighty with ideas that they created in a vacuum and thinking they 'know better' than their community. This is exactly what happened with Dawn of War III, The Culling, and Friday the 13th to name a few. The developers of those games made unwarranted and unasked for changes to their game and then proceeded to bite the bullet andkeep those changes even after they had received negative feedback from their community. All of those games were completely dead within 3 months of making those changes and sticking through with them. Because DBD has a much larger player base than those games it is more likely the players will significantly drop over an extended period of time. But this game could easily lose half its player base within 1 year if they keep doing this to their community. The game is bugged and the animations did not even need changes in the first place. I played a match where the match just ended when one person used the key to open hatch. Just instantly match end even though only one person went through the hatch. I am leaving a negative review to stop the trend of these terrible patches, even though this patch is still somewhat bearable. But BHVR needs negative feedback otherwise in 2 more bad patches this game could easily die off and I am trying to prevent that."

A lot of controversy and frustration, but im still able to say that this game can be really fun. But i wont lie, if they didnt have a lot of their crossover dlcs, i probably wouldnt have picked it up unless my friends were all playing. I'd also only recommend buying this game when it's on sale along with a bunch of the DLC, especially if you're a fan of the horror licenses that are included like. I'd also warn that a lot of people playing this game can be incredibly toxic, but if you're able to handle that, then you should be fine. I've actually met a lot of awesome people through the game itself and through streaming it, so there's always those little gleams of light here and there. Oh and one last thing... please play both sides of the game! Because if the game gets frustrating, you can just switch to the other side for a breather, and it helps you understand both roles a lot better."

The real devils are the survivors in this game. You have no idea how evil these pure-looking creatures are. In the story, they are the ones being haunted. You would think that this is true until you play killer for a while. You are not hunting them, they are hunting you. These disgusting devils will taunt the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you at every second they possibly can. They will wait minutes in the exit gate just to press CTRL and taunt you. They will use lag hacks just to annoy the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you. In my 20 hours killer experience. I have understood that the killers are more innocent than the survivors."

            "Comment": "I, as a devoted fan of Dead by Daylight, have spent over 3000 hours in this game. Over this time, I have witnessed many changes, both positive and negative. The problem I've encountered is not only the developers' policy of dividing players based on region, but also, unfortunately, the rampant cheating that no one seems to be combating. Bhvr, in my opinion, treats some regions as first-class and others as second-class, and this is reflected not only in exclusive content but also, possibly, in different approaches to moderation in different regions. This logic is incomprehensible to me. Releasing exclusive content for specific regions creates an artificial division between players, undermines the sense of community unity, and generates dissatisfaction. Apparently, they have already earned enough money, and they no longer need it. And such a simple idea that it is necessary to unite people, not divide them, is apparently too difficult for Bhvr. Therefore, until their policy changes for the better, I am forced to stop spending any money on their projects, and I see no point in continuing to play them. It's not so much the skins themselves that matter, but rather the dismissive attitude from BHVR. Good luck to them with such decisions."

This game has turned into nothing more then a game where one side tries to ensure that the other side can have as little fun as possible instead of just trying to enjoy a asymmetric game for a more casual play. In my last few matches as survivor all I face is the strongest killers, and all I face as killer matches are either meta builds or bully squads who just want to ruin your day, maybe if the community stops this who shtick of which side can make the other more miserable I can change my review."

Matchmaking is never balanced, rank doesn't matter, so then why place good survivors with inexperienced ones vs good killers or inexperienced killers? That doesn't make it very enjoyable. It makes it imbalanced and unfun for one or more parties. I play both killer and survivor and would love to play more, but what's the point? Releasing DLC to bandage problems the game has had for years is not a proper solution. They've been fixing maps to make them fair which is nice, but generator times/objectives are almost always survivor favored. Maps are generally survivor favored, I should know. I've seen the loops that are possible and not all infinites are gone yet, but they've said they're handling them - which they are, just not very fast. Like I said, releasing all these skins and DLC are not fixing the main issues. I just want the game to be fun again, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. I recommend taking breaks from the game when you know it's not going so well. Their servers need improvement and their matchmaking is terrible. I call it the Lobby Simulator for a reason."

If you want to be good at this game you're going to have to put work into it like any other game you play.  The downsides to this game is the killer hosts the lobbies for the survivors. Which means if the killer has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ internet or if you have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ internet, you and/or the survivors are going to be masters of teleportation. The match making everytime they update it is a hit or miss. Usually of which only screws up SWF (Survive With Friends). So, if you want to purchase this game to que up with some friends you should probably do a bit of research on how the match making is doing. Other than that the game is very fun to play with buddies.!~"

There are few competitive games on the market like it and it's fun to play with friends. Not labor of love worthy right now, but it did start that way. With some fixes and better support it could be a pretty good game."

Sure I don't have many hours compared to most, yes I joined the game late and yes I still don't know everything to know about this game yet... I'm enjoying it and will put way more hours into this good game. Again, its not great or near perfect but I keep coming back to it!"

Hopefully they will be able to fix all the bugs in this game in the future with every new update.This game would be better if they can nerf the speed of gens rushing,which is REAL TOXIC, and also create a punishment for those killer players who face-camp the survivors.Anyway it is a fun game to play and it worth it."

This is all while being topped off with a community that craves self-fulfillment in their life by forcing a fun co-op game with friends to turn into a competitive esport, simultaneously lashing out at the players around them. Will I keep playing this game? Probably. It's fun with friends (albeit that isn't a genuine positive in my eyes, everything is fun with friends). It doesn't change the fact that this is a game where those who feel insecure about their lives and desperately need reaffirmation that they're good at something come to spend thousands of hours and knowledge check everyone around them for fake accomplishment. This game was never intended to be as competitive as people make it out to be and it's led to the degradation of a game that had a lot more potential."

Every patch brings 20 more bugs that will take half a year+ to fix, if ever fixed at all. And to top it all off, the battlepass cost + the cost of skins while the game is NOT free is just greedy. The game is okay if you're playing with friends but even then it's more of a headache than any fun when you try to have fun, the other side gets mad and tells you to walk off a bridge (but in not such a nice way). Wait til the games goes free or don't pick it up at all."

Ignoring important changes that would make this game fun again is unfortunately a common occurrence. A massive concern for me is the developers' paper-thin skin, getting defensive and hostile towards its players rather than internalizing the criticisms that could make this game great. If I ever wanted to stream DbD on my own channel, the hostility against criticism has convinced me I'm better off steering clear, lest I attract their wrath and they delete all of my dlcs and cosmetics from my account."

Bugs and balancing issues for days, followed by terrible servers on top of a roughly 10-15% cheater base. Behaviour consistently goes in the wrong direction with nerfs and buffs, and fails to see dozens of other games do their formula better."

Save your self from this toxic relationship and stay away. The only thing that keeps anyone from coming back is that is it really the only Asymmetrical multiplayer horror game that is decent. Other than that be prepared for a deep breathing and \"whoosahing\". The DBD community is also super toxic so both survivor and killer behavior mid game play is just annoying. Cheating killers and self survivors are quite popular. You can be a skilled gamer but if you get paired up with teammates whose only motive is to survive and escape then you are out of luck. Looped the killer for all five gens then get camped on hook in end game, YAY. Do all five gens while other survivors hide and teebag the killer only to die in end game because no-one wanted to unhook you, YAY. Get tunneled from the start of the game only to play for a whooping 3 mins, YAY. Playing as a new killer because the survivors are crappy team mates? Be prepared to be teebaged at every pallet and window vault. IT USED TO BE RANDOM MATCH MAKING which made it fair. Now they claim its based on hrs or win/lose ratio. BULL. The match making is trash and so is this game. Deuces."

            "Comment": "This Game is essentially Murder: The Hide and Seek Video Game. You have two sides in each match, survivors, and killers. One killer hunts down four survivors, and one killer has to do the job as such. They(The survivors) don't get any weapons and will have to escape using perks (skills, running faster for 3 seconds with a 40-60 second cooldown) or items like flashlights (blinds and stuns the killer so he can't see you run away for around 5 seconds or so.) They can also drop what are called 'pallets' onto killer players which are found in tight corners or open spaces to give more distance, as the killer has to spend time breaking it or going around to get to you again. However, they do have an advantage. The second that you run you leave little red 'scratch marks' on the ground that lead the killer to you. Most of the time when you are hit, you will be put into the wounded state, meaning you limp around while crying and drop blood, the killer can follow that blood directly to you, so the main job is to hide and not be found, as the longer you're chased the more disadvantages you'll have (Such as the killer attaining bloodlust, which makes him move way faster, on top of them already moving faster than you in the first place). It's not designed to be a fair 1v1 experience, it's designed to be a 4v1, and as such the killer is much stronger than a survivor and as such can easily beat them after a short time and put on a hook. If you get hung on a hook you have a certain amount of time to get off before the game kills you. Known as 'stages' each time you're on the hook you'll progress a stage, or if you're on too long. There's three stages. The first you can get out of the hook with ease, the second you'll have to mash spacebar constantly to avoid going into three, someone will have to rescue you before you die. It's a VERY fun game with a wide variety of options and ways to have fun. Don't be worried about the 'toxic community' as the only time the enemy team can even talk to you is post-match if you're killer, and as survivor only for the first few seconds before the match starts. During the game no contact can be made by or to either side, making the tension and teamwork a requirement. I heavily recommend this game if you have friends and plan to play survivor, or if you don't and want to be a killer. Being a survivor alone isn't that bad. People say that you'll get tunneled (The only survivor the killer hunts) and die, and while this is true, it doesn't matter at all. What tactics are employed by either side are a part of the game (Save the occasionally patched exploit.) In all, this is a very fun game for people who casually play games, or people who seriously play games. It doesn't matter how you enjoy games, there's a place here for you. If you're concerned about salty or toxic people just don't read the pre/post-game chat and you won't see problems. (Yes, tbagging can happen to you as killer but in that case just camp their hook and kill them, as killer you have the option to do whatever you please with them, and 'winning' is entirely subjective.) Ranks are the only real 'reason' to win the game, if that's what you really want in a hide-and-seek game go for it. Bloodpoints will be rewarded either way, and the amount is based on the 'feats' you pull off in-game, not your rank nor rank up materials. The game is wonky and absolutely unfair to survivors/killers at times, but both sides always have options of dealing with this, there's no reason to complain about it, it's just fun. Play it for fun, not for ranking. It's a Hide and Seek game for crying out loud, just enjoy yourself!"

            "Comment": "Having played the game for a while, through several updates, changes, reverts, the whole works, I can confidently recommend you NOT buy this game. The devs have consistently ignored player feedback, and have recently been making a lot of changes that made the game worse than it already was. I like to personally say that it started going downhill when they released the MMR system, but that is just my opinion. This game used to be fun where you could dink around, and play for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles, but unfortunately, unless you are pretty good at the game, you can't. I've had several instances where I go in with the mentality that \"Yes, I'm going to have fun regardless of what happens!' only to have teammates that were awful, a killer that wipes the floor with your innards, or a team of survivors who were REALLY good and were complete jerks to you, just because they could. This game requires you, currently, to be really good at the game to have consistent fun, since otherwise it's a sweatfest for no reason. To note as well, the player base can be extremely rude and full of themselves. I've had SEVERAL end game match lobbies where MANY offensive slurs and phrases were sprung, and even if I report them, I have no idea if my report was actually listened too. Now, this game has also received it's fair share of hackers, that is a CONSISTENT problem that DbD has allegedly fixed, only for it to never be fixed. these hackers can do a multitude of different things but the main two are as follows; 1. Give themselves subtle buffs that it can be hard to tell if they were hacking and 2. Holding the game hostage that it becomes a battle of wills over who will disconnect first (matches have a set timer that if the match goes on for like 2 hours [don't remember the actual timer] the match will automatically end. Recently, it also has begun to feel as if the Devs have lacked inspiration in their chapter releases. Shining example is their most recent chapter with The Skull Merchant. The only thing this chapter has going for it is the Skull Merchants \"sex appeal\" and even then it missed the f'ing target. They then went and released their next Tome (this games battlepass system) where it focused on this chapter release, which was a horrid move on their end. Best part is, they went and made the pass free for amazon prime users, since they know the f'd up in the Chapter release. Overall, the devs are a complete joke to the point that I don't even think they exist, and its just the owner â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on all of us because he hates us. Recommendation, DON'T EVEN BOTHER, you'll hate it."

Can you guys play the silly game of watching yourself change? What did you change the steel bones into? I'm a human and killer player, and the skills you changed most recently are something that I can say set back the history of the game for many years, I've never seen such a ridiculous change, can you go to see more comments from your production team after the change? By the way, play more of your own games, do not understand the situation of the real game, you will change it like this, sooner or later all the people who play this game will be angry, go and play your own modified game, just like when you played the Hag when the game ended the change to her, you now change these skills more and more badly, humans and killers can not have a pleasant game experience, now it is forcibly let humans start the marathon, the killer can not control the scene because you weaken a lot of skills that affect the progress of the generator, Then you weaken the human survival skills, I love your game, but this change really disappoints me, this game is going downhill, is it because you have enough money to make you don't want to make anymore? If this continues, no one will continue to play your game, and the people who continue to play will be very painful in every game, so your production team should think about it, play more games you made, change the skills you feel are flawed from these practices, and then listen to the opinions of the players properlyï¼"

This causes survivors to not want to help each other during a match, because they know the only way to PIP up is by clearing generators and leaving, and not just Altruism alone will score you rank... so now people are discouraged to help each other because of this."

As it is, I would say to wait or find a different game. I am also writing this after having not played to see if I would come back to it, and ultimately, no, I have no desire to return to this game in it's current state."

Once you've finally entered a match, to then be immediately tunnelled, camped and killed, it ruins the entire experience and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. There's nothing wrong with this play style, but when the games are shorter than the queues, survivors never get a chance to learn/play and as a result become toxic and short tempered. I can't imagine the experience of a poor 40 year old father that comes home and finally has 40 minutes to spare, and decides to boot up DBD to be welcomed with 20 minute queue times, 5 minute matches, same 3 killers, and stagnant meta builds on everyone."

Only thing that can bring this game down would be the 'toxic players' that you can sometimes  be randomly teamed with.  Best solution (and what I find most fun) is teaming w friends.  If you're sensitive like me, solo Q can be difficult.. but w friends all the stress can be taken away leaving the game to be enjoyable as it is meant to be.  So far i've played 3,100 + hours in 2 1/2 years (xbox and steam combined).. so I feel I can attest to the fact that this is truly an amazing and challenging (in a good way) game <3"

Behavior Interactive is a cash grab company, trying to lure you in with their last surviving multiplayer game, only kept afloat by memes and Collaborative DLC. What can you expect from a 4v1 game where the voice of the 1 is drowned out by 4 times that. As you will see with many other reviews of the game, this game has more red flags than the average guy you match with on a dating app."

Queue times are still insane, and most of the time you are just stuck at a load screen then kicked back to the main menu. Also the community is toxic as hell. This game had promise, but dang... Sort out your priorities! Maybe instead of paid DLC, you should fix the base game."

Iâve been a casual enjoyer of the game; and playing whichever role I wanted to play has always felt very rewarding. Iâve always felt that the game was good â not great, but good â, and even though Iâd get outplayed sometimes, I felt that I was getting some achievement out of my matches. Ever since skill-based matchmaking has been introduced, and the game has released on Epic, Iâve noticed a general decline in player attitude. Friendly players are just a myth now. Sorry Behaviour, Iâve refrained from writing a review so far, but the game just isnât fun anymore. Too many people take bullying too far, and they donât shy away from making the killerâs and their teammateâs match utter hell. I donât think the next (and the next) chapter will change anything. Help me grab a shovel, and dig a hole for this game."

That's your only goal. And as the monster you have to kill the survivors. I appreciate the original idea, but it is not ambitious enough. There are a number of survivors and different monsters with different abilities and it is kind of balanced. But there is something about this game that prevented me from continuing to play after only one hour. I prefer to go back to Left 4 Dead 2 versus mode which is way more fun than this and by surviving you feel you actually did something. Overall I don't recommend this game because it is just not fun enough."

            "Comment": "the game is a buggy mess. every update its expected to have glitches and game breaking bugs which make it virtually unplayable. half of the time the prompt to drop pallets isn't even available for no reason at all. you can't play survivor unless you have a 4 stack who all know what they're doing because the game is severely killer sided and they have 0 intention in balancing it out. If you play solo, queue killer - although it becomes repetitive and boring and doesn't really have much charm to it/loses its charm very very quickly. the chances of winning solo queue survivor is not likely at all. there a LOT of things they could do to balance the game but it will never happen. It's a shame because the game would be very fun with correct programming and a few tweaks to the play style to make a more fair game."

The point system which recently got revamped is a nice idea but still marginally flawed, the skins are a little lame at times with events very sparingly used and some of the decisions haven't been for the better. But if you don't take the game too seriously and just want some fun, either solo or with friends, then this is a decent game and not the worse by any means."

Ce jeu n'arrÃ¨te pas de me surprendre, je vais de dÃ©couverte en surprise, dire que ce jeu est complet,le mot est faible. Je m'explique, au premier abord on plonge dans les fonds marins d'une planÃ¨te inconnu avec sa faune et sa flore  . AprÃ¨s avoir survecu au crash de votre mÃ¨ga vaisseau spatial , vous devez survivre Ã  bord de votre capsule de survie que vous allez devoir rÃ©parer . Mais lÃ  ou cela devient interessant, c'est que plus vous dÃ©couvrez d'espÃ¨ces d'animaux et de plantes, plus vous trouvez de dÃ©bris de vaisseaux ou autres engins, plus vous apprennez Ã  fabriquer d'objet , de vehicules ou de base sous-marine . Je suis trÃ¨s loin d'avoir tout dÃ©couvert malgrÃ© mes 20h de jeu et c'est dÃ©jÃ  trÃ¨s prenant . Les biomes sous-marins sont trÃ¨s variÃ©s et plus ou moins profond ( jusqu'Ã  + de 650 m ) habissal ! La construction de votre base sous-marine se doit de respecter les lois de la pression , plus elle sera profonde , plus il y a de risque que la pression de l'eau ouvre des breches dans la coque ou fissure les vitres etc . Bref, dire qu'il faut survivre avec tout Ã§Ã  ! La map est gÃ©ante , le craft juste Ã©norme , la dÃ©couverte je suis bluffÃ© , je suis fan . Addictif ."

Bref je me suis lancÃ© et j'ai pas regrettÃ©. Alors oui c'est encore un jeu en Early, evidemment il n'est pas finit et ca se ressent sur plusieurs points, basse de framerate, bugs, affichage tardif du dÃ©cor, bref une Early quoi, mais quelle ambiance, on est tout de suite happer par l'univers de Subnautica, un monde aquatique vivant, beau, flippant par moment, accompagnÃ© d'une excellente ambiance sonore ! Difficile de lachÃ© le jeu une fois lancÃ© ! manque peu etre encore de contenu mais les maj arrive petit Ã  petit rajoutant Ã  chaque fois son lot de nouveautÃ© (et de correctif) Le jeu est graphiquement plus que correct pour une Alpha, plus qu'une chose Ã  dire, vivement le produit final, evidement si vous Ãªtes allergique aux early, attender encore un peu, sinon, si vous avez envie de dÃ©couvrir une expÃ©rience aquatique unique en avance, n'hÃ©siter pas."

Subnautica ne comporte aucun de ces aspects. Un univers original, trÃ¨s joli et attachant, un gameplay simple et intuitif, pas besoin de farmer 50 million de ressources pour crafter quoique ce soit -le jeu prÃ©fÃ©rant rendre les plus rares difficilement accessibles-, les espÃ¨ces agressives peuvent faire trÃ¨s peur (surtout si vous avez l'angoisse des fonds marins comme moi) mais l'exploration est intÃ©ressante et suprenante.

Mais Ã  mon avis le plus gros problÃ¨me que des nouveaux joueurs pourraient rencontrer serait la courbe de difficultÃ© juste abusÃ© du jeux, si vous voulez vous investir dans le jeux il vas falloir s'accrochÃ© durant les premiÃ¨res heures et Ãªtre rigoureux dans son apprentissage des mÃ©caniques .Pour autant je le recommande trÃ¨s vivement, car passÃ© ces premiÃ¨res heures fastidieuse le jeux est d'une richesse que je n'ai encore qu'effleurer."

Le type de gameplay est assez simple au premier abord mais on se rend trÃ¨s vite compte de l'infnitÃ©e de faÃ§on de jouer chaque hÃ©ros ayant des combos tous diffÃ©rent, certain dirons que le jeu est mal Ã©quilibrÃ©... moi je leurs rÃ©pond que for honor n'est pas un jeu simple et qu'on est pas sur fortnite il faut avoir du skill pour savoir bien jouer Ã  for honor au dÃ©but on se fait rÃ©tamer par IA la plus simple puis on progresse on apprend de ses herreur on se familiarise un  peu plus avec chaque personnages et on fini par avoir un peut de skill. Chaque combat est diffÃ©rent car chaque personne peut jouer diffÃ©remment le mÃªme personnage et c'est ce qui fait que le jeu ne se rÃ©pÃ¨te pas et est toujours plus exigent avec nous et pour finir ''les personnages mal Ã©quilibrÃ©'' oui bien sÃ»r c'est ce qui est apparemment beaucoup reprocher au jeu alors dÃ©jÃ  oui il y a des personnages qui font plus de dÃ©gats et sont trÃ¨s rapides, la raison ? classe assassin et dans ces conditions les hÃ©ros assasins ont peut de vie et aucune compÃ©tence de rÃ©gÃ¨ne Ã  part les exÃ©cutions. Des perso qui ont des coups qui fonts extrÃªmement mal et qui on beaucoup de pv ? ce cera surment un tank il aura donc des coup puissant mais trÃ¨s lent et donc facilement parable ou esquivable, il sera Ã©galement trÃ¨s peut mobile et disposera d'une assez petite stamina. Donc le prochain que vous voyer avec comme commentaire ''Les perso sont pas Ã©quilibrÃ©'', ''Les parades passes jamais'' ou ''Le jeu est lent et incomprÃ©hensible'' Soit ce n'est pas leur type de jeu ce que je peut consevoir car il faut une paire d'heure avant d'avoir un petit niveau (mais ils sont quant mÃªme de mauvaise fois) Sois il ne savent pas jouer et ils n'assument pas d'Ãªtre mauvais ^^"

Tout est assez bien pensÃ© par contre je trouve un petit manque d'objectif sur le mode survie contrairement Ã  d'autres jeux, l'exemple le plus logique est Minecraft, on est libre de faire ce qu'on veut mais il y a quand mÃªme l'ender dragon et le Wither Ã  battre. Sinon j'ai un bug bien trop Ã©nervant ma touche pour se dÃ©placer vers la gauche (q)  bug (elle reste activÃ©e) cela ne vient pas de mon clavier car j'ai essayÃ© avec plusieurs clavier et rien, toujours le mÃªme bug j'ai l'impression que c'est en rapport avec la touche maj pour sprinter. A part ce bug et un petit manque d'objectifs en mode survie le jeu est trÃ¨s complet en terme de mÃ©canique (heureusement d'ailleurs) et est donc trÃ¨s plaisant Ã  jouer ! Je recommande Ã©videmment ce jeu Ã  toutes les personnes qui aiment construire et crÃ©er des systÃ¨mes (je pense aux joueurs de Minecraft qui ne sont pas comblÃ©s avec la redstone)"

Je modifie mon Ã©valuation ayant fini le jeu, j'en suis arrivÃ© Ã  bout en 15h de jeu, ce qui est trÃ¨s honnÃªte pour un jeu de ce style, les petites chutes de fps ont pour la plupart Ã©tÃ© corrigÃ©es mais pas toutes ce qui laisse supposer que d'autres patchs arriveront. Il s'agit d'un vÃ©ritable remake, oÃ¹ certaines choses se passent diffÃ©remment, le jeu est plus cohÃ©rent dans sa gÃ©nÃ©ralitÃ© (Par exemple par l'apparition de Pnj etc... on est seuls mais tout n'est pas tout Ã  fait dÃ©cimÃ© Ã  notre arrivÃ©e sur l'Ishimura, rajout de profondeur sur certains personnages) Je note aussi que malgrÃ© qu'EA soit l'Ã©diteur, au lancement du jeu il ne demande mÃªme pas de me connecter Ã  Origin, je suppose que Ã§a passe entiÃ¨rement par Steam et Ã§a sa fait plaisir (Avec tous ces launchers diffÃ©rents, Ã§a file la gerbe). Le jeu est vraiment une version ++ du Dead Space de l'Ã©poque et vaut vraiment le coup mÃªme si l'ont Ã  dÃ©jÃ  fait celui de l'Ã©poque."

            "Comment": "Mais on y retrouve aussi tout ce qui avait dÃ©jÃ  fait le succÃ¨s de Dead Space en 2008, et plus encore : l'immersion est totale (notamment grÃ¢ce Ã  l'absence de HUD et de temps de chargement), la bande originale efficace, et le design sonore contribue Ã  instaurer un climat de terreur permanent (Ã§a peut se traduire par un cri Ã  glacer le sang qui surgit de nulle part, le rÃ¢le d'une crÃ©ature tapie dans l'ombre ou la simple respiration de notre personnage qui tranche avec le silence environnant). MalgrÃ© la dÃ©ferlante de crÃ©atures affreuses qui dÃ©filent Ã  l'Ã©cran, l'essentiel de la peur se transmet par le son. La mÃ©canique de dÃ©membrement, qui consiste Ã  viser les articulations des ennemis pour en venir Ã  bout plus facilement, a Ã©tÃ© remise au goÃ»t du jour : une fois couplÃ©e aux nouveaux modes de tir secondaires et aux autres pouvoirs de Clarke, qui peut aussi ralentir ses ennemis Ã  grand renfort de stase et dÃ©placer des objets par tÃ©lÃ©kinÃ©sie, chaque combat devient une fÃªte (une fÃªte qui tourne au vinaigre, avec des convives qui rampent au plafond et qui explosent au contact, mais une fÃªte quand mÃªme). Pour le reste, le remake n'est pas parfait pour autant, les environnements auraient pu Ãªtre encore plus beaux (mÃªme si les lumiÃ¨res sont toujours sublimes), les zones de non gravitÃ© encore plus plaisantes Ã  jouer, les menus un peu plus attrayants. Mais pour tous les amoureux du premier, et les amateurs du genre qui auraient eu la chance de passer Ã  cÃ´tÃ©, c'est une Åuvre faite avec beaucoup d'amour, qui se permet constamment de tutoyer les Ã©toiles."

Skill trees and direct stat customization are out, with most abilities and offensive options being determined by loot to a greater degree than similar games. For those new to the genre or those otherwise looking for a breezier version of it, particularly children, Minecraft Dungeons should be a solid experience, but more experienced players may be left in want by its lack of apparent depth."

            "Comment": "I admit that I played this game previously on Playstation with a little couch co-op with my sons, but haven't played it for some time. When I saw it come to Steam I was excited since I play mostly PC. I have really been enamored with the game. I didn't buy into the Diablo 2 hype and I love action RPG's. I knew I liked this game already, but I didn't know how much I needed a game where I can pop in and out for a few minutes or hours at a time. I have so much fun finding new builds and enchanting new armor and weapons, playing with my son co-op is still easily the best thing. It's so easy to join friends games so I applaud them there. The ability to toggle difficulty is great too when you are playing with people or kids who need it to feel a little bit more epic and not as much dying. The difficulty is definitely there though if you are trying to get the highest level artifacts and weapons/ armor. I really enjoy the game and I hope to continue playing it here on PC for quite some time!"

The game has online and local multiplayer, and with all the DLC it takes a long time to get through the game. I am posting this 24 hours in and I'm not even close to half way done. If you like Dungeon Crawlers and Minecraft, then get this."

La diversitÃ© des vÃ©hicules (plus de 800), des supercars aux bolides tout-terrain, offre une variÃ©tÃ© de sensations de conduite. La physique rÃ©aliste et le souci du dÃ©tail dans la modÃ©lisation des voitures procurent une expÃ©rience authentique et immersive. Les nombreuses activitÃ©s et dÃ©fis rÃ©partis dans le monde ouvert obligent d'y jouer des dizaines et dizaines d'heures et garantisses une certaine durÃ©e de vie dans le temps du jeu, garantissant des heures de jeu sans l'ombre d'une monotonie et, personnellement donnant la sensation d'avoir vraiment bien dÃ©pensÃ© son argent dans ce jeu!"

If you're unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game, i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like (just note that there are NO cross saves between the MS store platform and steam, so you will need to start over if you're switching between versions!)."

Et d'un autre cÃ´tÃ©, vous avez des bugs et plantage Ã  rÃ©pÃ©tition. Petite prÃ©cision avant de venir me critiquer, ma configuration est largement au-dessus de la moyenne recommandÃ©e (Ryzen 9, 32Go de ram,...) ;) J'avoue ne pas m'expliquer le nombre de problÃ¨me liÃ© Ã  FH5. Un jour je peux jouer sans souci pendant une journÃ©e entiÃ¨re, et le lendemain je vais me faire sortir du jeu ou planter dans les menus plusieurs fois Ã  la suite (connexion serveur compris...).

Je possÃ¨de une RTX 3080 neuve, un Ryzen 9 neuf, 32Go de RAM, une B550F neuve, et un watercooling neuf.... bref un monstre en sois, je fais tourner tous les dernier jeux qui demandes Ã©normÃ©ment Ã  fond en 2k Ã  plus de 110-120 FPS constant, dont Forza Horizon 4 lol Ã©videmment. J'ai jouÃ© au 1, 2, 3, 4 mais le 5..., mon Dieu le 5.... Le 5 est d'une infamie sans nom, bourrÃ© de bugs en tous genre et surtout graphiques sur PC, c'est injouable, il marche 1 fois sur 2 car quand on le lance des fois le jeu dÃ©cide de tourner Ã  4 FPS constant (vrai anecdote), et d'autres il veut bien marcher mais avec une qualitÃ© graphique immonde (j'ai dÃ©jÃ  rÃ©glÃ© le problÃ¨me de la mise en Ã©chelle de la rÃ©solution mais c'est impossible que le jeu soit comme je le vois graphiquement je ne veux pas le croire, dans ce cas les rabats joie qui disent que FH4 est plus beau ont presque raison). Donc voilÃ  la liste est encore longue avec les vibrations qui ne marchent que 1 fois sur 4 avec la manette ou bien le curseur de la souris qui ne veut pas sâenlever... Bref, en attente d'un bon patch sinon c'est remboursement direct malheureusement"

J'ai du refaire 5 fois la course d'introduction... je me suis dit que mon PC n'Ã©tais pas suffisamment puissant pour le faire tourner, j'ai baisser les graphismes Ã  fond, rien Ã  faire toujours pareil. Sauf qu'a un moment par miracle c'est passÃ© !! Depuis, que je joue avec les graphismes en Ã©levÃ© ou en trÃ¨s bas, le jeu crash toute les 10 minutes, les serveurs multis sont une horreur (dÃ©connexion frÃ©quente). Bref c'est le premier avis que je laisse sur Steam, je ne recommande pas en l'Ã©tat."

            "Comment": "I want to say this game is good, I really do, I love playing it, and I love being in the game racing. But I feel like this game could be a LOT better with next to no effort from the development team. They could fix the unbalanced cars and instantly make the game 100x more fun to play online. They could remove cheated leaderboard scores & make getting the highest score mean something. They could actually add unique cars to the region, or listen to their damn community, but they won't. This feels like a \"safe profit\" game. A game manhandled by some execs into losing its soul just so it could be an easy game to profit from. It feels corporate, its not the same horizon you had as a child/teen on your xbox 360, and its not the same game as the previous title. Its a soulless husk of a game within a series that was at one point the greatest open world racing experience. I'm still going to play it, its one of the only open-world racing games & I dont exactly have a choice to fill that niche. I want this game to be the best it can be, but it really feels like i've joined just as the ship was going down. Good Graphics wont save a game with an awful experience, and this has been a champion of awful experiences lately."

Mais, mÃªme si on lui souhaite dâÃ©voluer encore un peu plus notamment sur la surface et les distances Ã  parcourir (Ã  voir ce quâÃ  fait ASOBO avec Flight Simulator, on se prend Ã  rÃªver dâun Ã©quivalent en jeu de voitures) on peut faire confiance au dÃ©veloppeur et Ã  Xbox Games Studios pour rajouter du contenu rÃ©guliÃ¨rement.

Les 3/4 des packs sont onÃ©reux et bien souvent tu seras dÃ©Ã§u (surtout pour les packs avec des velins). ApprÃ©hende bien le jeu, suit bien l'histoire et le chemin de l'invocateur, fait ton niveau 100, rejoint une guilde pour dÃ©couvrir tranquillement tous les contenus que propose le jeu et tu auras acquis assez d'expÃ©rience pour savoir si tu souhaites investir ou pas dans ce jeu. n'hÃ©site pas Ã  poser les questions nÃ©cessaires Ã  ton Ã©volution dans ton canal de guilde, il n'y a pas de question bÃªte et cela t'Ã©vitera de faire des erreurs de dÃ©butant (choix des monstres, set de runes, utilisation des angemons). La patience est maÃ®tre mot si tu souhaites performer un jour sur ce jeu ! bon courage"

However, the PC version is really badly optimized, causing mostly some minor bugs and sometimes instability problems causing your game to crash (around 3 times per sessions of 4 hours which is annoying) and even causing your PC to crash or freeze (as i tested to launch the game twice in a row before blue screen to be sure that it was the game the problem). That is why i will continue to play on the mobile version, but i will never play on the PC version again to preserve my PC \"health\", until they release a patch to solve those problems."

Beaucoup de nouveaux joueurs se plaignent de ne pas avancer vite mais il faut savoir que les joueurs ayant crÃ©Ã© leur compte en 2018 ou moins c'Ã©tait encore plus difficile. Les Ã©vÃ©nements qu'il y a eu rÃ©cemment Ã©tait juste OP c'Ã©tait du Free To Play pour les nouveaux joueurs. Ãvitez de vous plaindre Ã  la moindre occasion, ce jeu demande beaucoup de temps et beaucoup de tactique mais c'est cela qui fait le succÃ¨s de ce jeu. En tout cas si vous avez du temps, que vous avez la possibilitÃ© de afk sur le jeu et que vous aimez les jeux de tactiques et complexe je vous le conseil sans hÃ©sitation."

Le jeu a du potentiel de fou mais ils en font rien. 10ans que je joue, et malgrÃ© toute l'Ã©volution du jeu, les fondations du jeu n'Ã©voluent pas avec les nouveaux standarts existant alors que les joueurs en font la demande constante. La quantitÃ© de joueur ne fait que baisser de saison en saison, sur tous les contenus dispo mais rien ne se passe. C'est triste."

As for now emulators are more optimized and have better UI. The font is too small for big screens, not being able to swipe down in the events pages is frustrating, and swiping in the classic rune management or on the \"world page\" is bugged (sometimes swipes when you just want to go slow). Also relogging every session and the windows notification sound every time you write in chat is VERY annoying."

AprÃ¨s 8 ans de dÃ©veloppement, il est normal de sâattendre Ã  un jeu fini, mais le jeu vient dâarriver et les dÃ©veloppeurs nous proposaient dÃ©jÃ  un patch correctif moins de 48h aprÃ¨s sa sortie. Le pc de ma copine n'Ã©tant pas suffisant pour faire tourner le jeu, nous l'avons Ã©galement pris sur PS4 pro, j'ai lu que sur les premiÃ¨res versions de ps4 et xbox le jeu Ã©tait un enfer, aucun souci pour le moment sur la version Pro Ã  part 2-3 soucis d'affichage, c'est clairement jouable et apprÃ©ciable. Mais si je n'arrive pas Ã  comprendre toutes ces critiques, c'est que l'univers est bien lÃ  lui et mon dieu qu'il est prenant. L'ambiance sonore vous prend au tripes, l'impression de se balader dans Blade Runner est incroyable, les diffÃ©rents quartiers traversÃ©s apporte une immersion incroyable, chaque coin de la carte que j'ai traversÃ© pour l'instant Ã  sa propre identitÃ©. Je retrouve dans ce jeu la mÃªme violence que celle traversÃ©e par John Difool des bandes dessinÃ©e L'Incal, cette ville extrÃªme Ã  tous points de vue dans laquelle chacun(e)s rÃªve sois de s'Ã©lever pour Ã©chapper Ã  cette violence oÃ¹ alors faire partie de cette mÃªme violence en devenant l'un des maÃ®tres de la ville. Les compÃ©tences sont sacrÃ©ment nombreuses et proposent de s'orienter dans de nombreuses voix (infiltration, piratage, gros bourrin,...). Je passe des heures juste Ã  me balader dans les diffÃ©rents quartiers de la ville, avec le choix d'avancer dans la quÃªte principale, oÃ¹ de prendre le temps d'aider la police en les aidant sur une affaire, en participant Ã  des combats de boxe illÃ©gaux, en fessant du shopping (fringues, armes, implant robotique,...) dans les innombrables boutiques de la ville, oÃ¹ en aidant la population Ã  travers des dizaines et des dizaines de quÃªtes pour enfin rentrer se reposer dans son petit appartement, se prendre une douche (oui oui) et au choix aller se coucher, se mater un film les fesses dans son canapÃ© en cuir oÃ¹ alors en regardant Night City par sa fenÃªtre en rÃ©flÃ©chissant Ã  ce que cette ville incroyable nous rÃ©serve pour le lendemain."

Avec la sortie de l'animÃ© ainsi que de la 1.6, le jeux est tout bonnement une master classe. Et petit conseil, n'hÃ©sitez pas Ã  le modder, il y a de trÃ¨s bon mods pas trop gourmands et stables qui amÃ©liorent encore plus le gameplay. Donc encore une fois, si vous hÃ©sitiez ou que vous en avez entendu suite Ã  l'animÃ© et que vous avez envie d'essayer l'expÃ©rience, laissez vous tenter, je suis sur que de bonnes et longues heures de jeux vous attendent ^^"

La maladie du personnage c'est plutÃ´t virus informatique, incidence, un imprÃ©vu, l'effet secondaire d'une puce technologique Ã  mettre dans le corps. Une technologie encore incomplÃ¨te, inachevÃ©e, un produit en cours de test, une marchandise de plus. Une valeur boursiÃ¨re que le personnage a collÃ© dans sa tÃªte (il ne voulait pas, il ne savait pas). La puce n'Ã©tait pas censÃ©e prÃ©cipiter la mortalitÃ©, c'est l'immortalitÃ© qu'elle devait vendre. Pour Ã§a, ratÃ©. \"Il y a des milliards de gens sur cette terre, Ã§a peut pas marcher pour tout le monde\", c'est ce que dit une rencontre quelque part. Les milliards veulent croire qu'ils ne sont pas comme les milliards, ils veulent un destin personnel, une reconnaissance. La puce dans la tÃªte et c'est fini, ce qui va se passer ne peut plus Ãªtre changÃ©. Pourtant le personnage continue d'y croire (par un trucage de l'espÃ©rance). Et les joueurs (par l'illusion du contrÃ´le), les joueurs aussi puisque c'est jouable."

RÃ©sumer Cyberpunk 2077 en un jeu buguÃ© serait une grossiÃ¨re erreur et dÃ©valoriserait l'immense travail fourni par les dÃ©veloppeurs ces derniÃ¨res annÃ©es. Certes, les promesses du dÃ©but qui annonÃ§aient une vÃ©ritable rÃ©volution vidÃ©oludique et des possibilitÃ©s infinies sont obsolÃ¨tes mais il faut prendre Cyberpunk comme ce qu'il est aujourd'hui : il est loin d'Ãªtre parfait, cependant il reste un trÃ¨s bon rpg futuriste proposant une bonne immersion. Le riche univers de Cyberpunk peuplÃ© de personnages attachants sont un vrai plus au jeu. MalgrÃ© ses dÃ©fauts, ses bugs, ses dÃ©ceptions et j'en passe, Cyberpunk 2077 reste un excellent jeu bien que ne rÃ©volutionnant ni le genre ni le paysage vidÃ©oludique."

En 2024 je ne peux rien dire d'autre, Cyberpunk est enfin un action RPG narratif trÃ¨s fortement recommandable depuis sa refonte complÃ¨te de l'arbre de compÃ©tence avec la version 2.0, et il vous offrira des heures de fun et des personnages inoubliables qui vous marqueront Ã  vie."

Je me suis surpris Ã  avoir une quantitÃ© astronomique de sreenshots une fois mon aventure terminÃ©e.  DeuxiÃ¨mement l'univers cyberpunk est pour ma part rÃ©ussi avec brio ! On retrouve trÃ¨s clairement les grands thÃ¨mes de celui-ci, technologies avancÃ©es, cyberespace, techno-capitaliste, l'ambiance lourde des pubs ainsi que les nÃ©ons flashy, les hauts buildings, hologrammes, les rues malfamÃ©es , gangrÃ©nÃ©es par de multiples gangs et des cyberspychos dÃ©jantÃ©s ! Je n'ai rien Ã  redire de ce cÃ´tÃ©-lÃ  , quand on se balade dans Night City on a vraiment l'immersion pure et dure du monde futuriste dystopique de type Cyperpunk ! L'un des rares jeux d'ailleurs oÃ¹ je me suis quasiment jamais tÃ©lÃ©portÃ©, je me suis perdu dans cette ville aussi bien Ã  pied qu'en voiture m'arrÃªtant toutes les 2Â mins pour contempler cette DA incroyable ! TroisiÃ¨mement pour l'intrigue CD Projekt Red est sÃ»rement l'un des studios les plus qualifiÃ©s pour nous raconter une histoire. Les personnages sont attachants , leurs expressions du visage ainsi que leurs gestes sont naturels c'est assez bluffant ! On a vraiment l'impression d'Ãªtre dans un film , la narration y est excellente ! Tous ces points positifs me font oublier les quelques points nÃ©gatifs comme la conduite discutable et les quelques bugs que j'ai pu rencontrer lors de mon pÃ©riple. Bref , j'ai vraiment aimÃ© arpenter Night City je ne voulais pas mettre fin Ã  cette histoire , il me tarde de mettre la main sur ce DLC afin de pouvoir me replonger dans cette univers rocambolesque !"

Rien que l'architecture de la ville, tortueuse, labyrinthique (On est au antipodes des rues Ã  la manhattan, pour aller d'un point A Ã  un point B IL FAUT SUIVRE LE GPS, si vous tentez d'y aller en suivant l'icone bÃªtement vous allez finir dans un fossÃ© ou un â¥â¥â¥ de sac) avec ses \"villes dans la ville\". C'est simple, personnellement j'ai l'impression que CDProject vient de donner une Ã©norme mandale Ã  Rockstar (et ne parlons meme pas d'Ubisoft...) en termes de crÃ©ation d'un monde ouvert. Imbriquer autant de mÃ©caniques dans un openworld aussi dÃ©taillÃ© releve de la folie. J'ai pas encore terminÃ© le jeu mais force est que on est sur un jeu qui va avoir l'impact d'un zelda botw. Les autres Ã©diteurs vont observer en silence, puis aller sur ces pistes de gameplay/narration que les joueurs auront acclamÃ©. Pour les combats, pour l'instant je suis content du gameplay hybride entre deus ex et fallout, il y a une certaine lourdeur en dÃ©but de partie qui part une fois qu'on a montÃ© sa classe dans la direction qui nous plait. Les sÃ©quences d'enquete sont trÃ¨s crÃ©atives dans leur contenu mais la forme (les mecaniques) deviennent assez rÃ©pÃ©titives. La narration. TrÃ¨s gros point fort car mise en synergie avec son obsession, l'immersion. On interagit et vous donne des informations comme une personne sensÃ©e le ferait. On telephone, on interpelle de loin avant mÃªme que vous ayez Ã  appuyer sur un bÃªte bouton \"interagir\", on vous balance Ã  la gueule le suicide d'un personnage avec une franchise glaÃ§ante qui personnellement m'a destabilisÃ© comme jamais. Bref, si vous avez de quoi le faire tourner, attendez les patchs si certains commentaires vous dÃ©couragent mais surtout si vous aimez le RPG, les mondes ouverts et le futur (dystopique, mais futur tout de mÃªme) pour votre propre plaisir serait un crime de ne pas y jouer."

Gunplay is satisfying, progression feels real and organic; at no point do you ever feel over or underpowered. The experience just feels balanced. This game is genuinely what i consider to be the best Single player game of all time."

Before this it had been many years since playing ANY games. So, I am floored by this game. To me its amazing. Now I set the combat at an easy level and I bumble around in here and am in no hurry. I explore around sometimes doing nothing but looking around. I have gone through a fair amount of the story line - again - its all amazing to me. In short I love it. I now am branching to more games, as I find I enjoy playing more then one game at a time. I love the characters of this game, the visuals of it, and have no complaints. Occasionally I run across a very minor glitch of getting stuck or something, but this does not bother me. I do not expect perfection. But I want to emphasize this is very rare. Well done to the developers of this game."

I had a blast and my only true gripe with the game is that it's unfortunately still riddled with bugs. You won't encounter anything game-breaking, but it is worth mentioning, so keep that in mind. Regardless of that though, I was still pleasantly surprised, and this is probably my favorite game I played this year. Long live Night City."

There are layers of strategy and tactics not only in the immediate choices you make, but also in the more global meta of the game that you understand through your trials. Dead Cells is a triumphant union of instinct, foresight, fun and failure."

Yes, you'll die a lot, but it never feels like a big deal. The point of the game is in the moment to moment combat anyway -- and the fact that you're rewarded for each run in a slow permanent progression means you never feel cheated. Highly recommended."

Il a du nÃ©cessiter un nombre de pelles cosmique aux dÃ©vs pour se racler aussi bien la soupiÃ¨re et nous offrir une si grande diversitÃ© de gameplay : chaque zone recÃ¨le sa petite spÃ©cificitÃ©, on Ã  les lÃ©gions d'ennemis et leurs paterns, les boss, les zones secrÃ¨tes, les secret des murs, les portails warps comme je les appelle. Sans oublier les armes et gadgets en tout genres, les runes, et les cellules de boss qui donnent une nouvelle jeunesse Ã  un jeu travaillÃ© au corps comme j'ai pu le faire. Le jeu est parfaitement optimisÃ© pour mannette et KB/M, j'en atteste, tests Ã  l'appui. Pour la config nÃ©cessaire, je ne peux me prononcer ; j'ai une machine de guerre. En dÃ©finitive, aller tout de suite acheter ce jeu pour soutenir ce studio franÃ§ais qui non content de produire un travail de qualitÃ© d'eux mÃªme, Ã©coute avec attention leur communautÃ© pour amÃ©liorer le jeu en fonction de ses joueurs.

Bonnes musiques, bons systÃ¨mes, bon graphismes. Ya de quoi s'y plaire. En revanche je pense que le jeu ne s'adresse pas Ã  des nÃ©ophytes du genre roguelite. Faut dÃ©jÃ  avoir les notions de bases et une bonne coordination tactique.

            "Comment": "Dead Cells, un grand classique du Rogue Like, rien Ã  redire, un jeu tout simplement incroyable fait pour ceux qui en ont dans le pantalon. En effet, ce jeu est non simplement dur, mais il y'a aussi une part de chance et si on fait une erreur, on peut dire au revoir Ã  1 h de progrÃ¨s. Mais ce rend ce jeu particuliÃ¨rement fascinant est non seulement la difficultÃ© extrÃªme qui Ã  fait disparaÃ®tre mon ancienne souris de la surface de la Terre, mais aussi la faÃ§on dont on peut y rejouer encore et encore. De plus, les DLC sont tous des masterclass Ã  bon prix qui rajoutent de bonnes quantitÃ© de contenus. Il ne faudrait non plus oublier la variÃ©tÃ©s des biomes et les visuals qui je trouve pour un jeu pixel est tout simplement trÃ¨s beau, une belle direction artistique etc... Mais bon ce jeu n'est pas parfait, dÃ©jÃ  il blesse au plus profond de l'Ã¢me mais le fait qu'on doit battre le boss final deux fois et non une fois. pour dÃ©bloquer la vraie fin. (je me plains surtout de Ã§a parce que je l'ai fais qu'une fois). Bon pour conclure, ce jeu est dur mais incroyable, si on a dÃ©jÃ  jouer Ã  des jeux tels Hollow Knight ou encore Blasphemous, ce jeu devrait Ãªtre une partie de plaisir (j'ai menti)."
